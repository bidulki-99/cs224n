You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can sit down as farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that falls into a place.
You just have to turn back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went on to bleed every week in the children's bathroom, until the teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret, actually.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that of adults we never get to know us.
You could be <unk> and please bring that man that I know you've seen.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> ovarian cancer, and I would like you to share this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I put them up to my around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even know that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they come out of glaciers or break off the ice.
Every iceberg has his own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to refuse and hold up to the end, whereas other people cannot be able to afford them, whereas others can't afford to get into a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated apart and themselves, largely as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts in the <unk>
As a iceberg melts a eardrum that releases freshwater freshwater rich in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments there are unique and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way for the life cycle.
Part of the ice in the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get to see a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I would like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg in average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one <unk> a baby.
So, two partners with a baby.
I don't want you to stand too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about conception. I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joined the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome joined the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and the life begins.
We'll get back to talk about them later.
And in my activity on the ground to the <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy of the -- to say, human bodies and <unk> how the body body have looked <unk> the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance works in my work is an activist, like <unk> or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with <unk> sex sex, individuals whose physical inherit does not fit into male and male sketches
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have an sex that doesn't bother in the ordinary form or a <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene, and it says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that are <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the recipients of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So, there are high testosterone and <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in a typically female.
When you <unk> the baby has a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast one, but it doesn't have the time, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And then they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his structure, <unk> I believe being a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome that has <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, and it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised like <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a kid and had just found that he had <unk> and a <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had a chromosomes in the uterus and the uterus were <unk> they were so active that, essentially creating a male.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, she was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with bacterial chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know well why that is happening.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies have been <unk> twins or <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health of the world.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman to be a female identity is to have a black anatomy of an African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people inside a same body.
The most high school case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> got <unk> their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters were called to wonder: "What do you run to do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that nature is so complicated that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women and between men and women and <unk> and we are all of us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of the science is in which the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were previously categories that are <unk> directly with categories, <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only is sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we put ourselves on a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we think of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we look at science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories, which are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the spheres of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in our current culture, are the struggles of the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of the nose and if it was still not <unk>
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put it in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with the dilemma of determining really death, and this puts us into a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories, in the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, <unk> people with ordinary bodies, but I have to admit that it gets to me.
We reported that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
<unk> from the point of view of a democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each other so much watching that <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The parents were <unk> and the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what the <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was going to be the political power of the blood being passed away from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The parents were rejected by the idea and they replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy of common and not the <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they are part of a <unk> system that was <unk> two things.
It was <unk> for democracy and at the same time to <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to get passed on from a <unk> idea of the birth of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look for example, the Declaration of 2005, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Human Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, the color of color that we assign to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow Movement <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we hold certain <unk>
But attention -- I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years were supposed to allow them to have sex or getting married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, at the other hand, was born June 1 March June 1 at 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right one -- sex -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that because it has a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
And Henry, the virtue of being considered -- if I don't have told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man who is being considered to be <unk> at the <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary. On his hand, does not have the same rights as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to map the line somewhere, so we're going to be <unk>
But a lot of people have caught up in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have the <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests for people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you about the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> it provides a solution.
It says that we should judge <unk> people not in the color of their skin, but on the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be able to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships than I know about 40 I know.
So how do we put the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is keeping this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We didn't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed unless they are willing to be killed, unless they are ready to be <unk> in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of <unk> twins and then pick them up, and so they took their <unk>
But when the phone asked the case to ask the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, and he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he has considered political asylum. Instead of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be those who are without <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to finish up -- I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical and <unk> thing is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sex difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers that I knew I was interested in Feminism -- I thought I was interested in <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "Is the shortest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> <unk> so there's nothing in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, more I think there is something else to be female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the brain and the male who makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people on the state of the state, it's possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think about where it wants to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just replaced it by buildings from apartments.
So imagine that half the ones that you wanted to live in your apartment will be owners and the other half is still not going to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have set out to avoid the <unk> and the causes of building them.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, to build a new apartment building completely new, always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I suggested that governments are <unk> new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent <unk> they would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
And in the next few elections, we have <unk> <unk> has been reported with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time of reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
So through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules, and they're usually the rules that prevent us move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent <unk> with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They call me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, I said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> which is a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to make this project, this is important, this might be the way for our country to move on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk again the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk with data, which included an image like this, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value in a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat there and showed the <unk>
And this explained -- that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be an option in a city that you might be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And we also get new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from countries <unk> they could benefit from the countries that help them establish and make the norms of <unk> so that they can all trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This photo is from there.
It could find a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their constitution.
In a country that just happened to happen by this <unk> crisis, the vote in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On the age of February passed again in another voting or one of the <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21, at the age of 21, an <unk> <unk> -- was the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a photo of a new city center that is building in North Korea is bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to <unk> and maybe they would have to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court of ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There's a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 billion people who say that they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year in Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents that have to leave behind their family to go and get a job -- sometimes they are mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
My friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public, and I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find pictures, and more recently, photographing and post on my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to the end of the <unk> people -- usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My mind is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anyone have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought up seven pairs of laundry and nothing else.
It flies inside exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me how the woman who walks on the middle of it,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
This is what I called this brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is electricity.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not only are you going to leave you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child you're wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like play to the <unk> or I remember her little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything that we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to six words for you: The golden <unk> are all going on.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again, when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave that week.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to all of these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy, <unk> <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and come up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this, with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We have to play with them, and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that I play with that parking bar I taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow them to do them and stay in a place.
This is a big model that you can have in the world, except that you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics in the physics of a few years, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't have the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody ever saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why he should.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then we do a very big focus on the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and a springboard and <unk> and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a way of <unk> that is found under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of rare things, but then when other people will come up with doing those things, because I don't want them to do them, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of the voyage of inanimate objects are not only people, and the wind that goes on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to push out all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it out of the air, and then they put it to a temperature of less than a degree at all.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found it moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breathing breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when I gave it a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and they didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillion of atoms that make that little piece of metal are still still and at the same time that those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
Over the rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one only atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal can be in two different places, why not you as well?
I mean, it's my logical <unk>
So imagine if they were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How to act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights down and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And then 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss that he was here and he allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- I didn't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
So better than show you the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've taken out of their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I am actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the New York museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and we click on the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You're moving around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the hall, of the hall, of the hall, of the hall.
continue to go forward. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information in <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really have to do with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started playing, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I walked out and found that kids were actually playing something.
So I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people of the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> on a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get to get even further down and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll really see what there is.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over at MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Van actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, you walk into this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we've just done a zooming in around.
It's about <unk> in the National Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they didn't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to their work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that makes me today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> bioluminescent pixel here.
In our lab we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin all the children in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in the spending of spending spending one in the last two decades.
It was some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1 I would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that real-time control systems are beginning to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting open computers to the open.
And as <unk> are beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can see, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
More than cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
It's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms are going to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- you can actually see a little bit of a <unk> a <unk> and he said, "What?"
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember in Italy -- played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the late early early people there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> of France.
You get people a quick call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
earns Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day they were to the center of the winning team and the prime minister ever then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today, we know everything about the fabric of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed a few small tags to track the trash in its system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, like you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
We went from <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that <unk> <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> I could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is to push on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with an mayor of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can come to the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> valves that they open up and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you get the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we took a commission to design the building of <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The entire building is made of water.
There's no windows or windows, but when you come up with it open, it opens up so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to be <unk> if you want to minimize your roof.
Or you can just close the building and all of the architecture is missing as in this case.
Those days always will be someone, in the winter, when they go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, "Do you get the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see the people <unk> for what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to try and try not to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let me happen, but a building that was still making cuts and holes in water, and you had to jump into it not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because like architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use them.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and you have a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that is moving in space.
This is the video.
So imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, it moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
It's sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal screen configuration in two dimensions.
Or it's normal -- but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appeared on different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D than you can get near and get it to see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When the lights lights up, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them <unk> for one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers today, the star <unk> of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a motion capture.
It can spread the entire movement.
You can go through the whole way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and motion with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm as a <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make everyone else, a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved the physical world into the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign we can tell us, we can move from the digital world of the <unk> power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may be we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, and how do we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel there.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel side.
You can move around with different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom -- to serve to share the main moments of the northern Olympic Olympics.
So it's a physical cloud of heaven as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go out there.
And as if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
They would like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just some changes on your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and safe, <unk>
What about living more health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do we do creativity?
Raise your hands. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little bit less.
What about <unk>
Ah, most of you, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED conference, but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Catholic Church of <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except by the light of the <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years old.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in fact, most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, but it is the same protein, but it is the same protein, which is <unk> that comes out of it.
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- you know, when Antonio <unk> is struck by the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully competent environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that can want no effort to their part.
It is really like a quick way for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of the occasional rush of the <unk>
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrient nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we ask the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, which is perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you have <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized a fundamental one, in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms -- every cell just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when organisms appear to come up, things start to change.
It goes into the sex reproduction.
And a very important thing -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year that was going on, every time I had more <unk>
I came to the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in his 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, he finds a magnificent dancer, light <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"He's <unk> says, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to regain the health in the disease.
I wanted them to live more and more more <unk>
Evolution consists of moving the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation after generation.
From an evolutionary perspective, you are and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all know the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to do the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily confuse longevity.
It doesn't necessarily confuse the bigger or the stronger or more quickly and even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and successful.
In the bottom of the ocean in the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that you can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there was fish there, fish holes in <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look at the process of <unk> I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and half the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that we need for evolution.
A second possibility is that the evolution of the traditional guy, natural type, dictate by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of the evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the kind of <unk> planets are going to exist, and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally as well.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing and intriguing possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that a lot of people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and familiar.
Think about that if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic adjustments for cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make the genetic changes in order to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
Don't you want to make those changes on your <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year of finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of a lot to make the human genome actually make the human genome -- and it will be increasingly more and more at the reach of all.
They come to those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to engage against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course the vaccine against the vaccine against the flu flu cells in a heart plant cells.
You can imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn <unk> and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life remove the diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> that same engine of the science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> of an Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we want to become the evolution of the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would usually take a thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
Let's build a society that's more boring and more and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before I could give you these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants of flight.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
So the pilot would take the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
So imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three most <unk> words I've heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight flying.
I was able to see it in his eyes, too.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and I didn't did, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've ever wanted to have and never <unk>
While I thought about it, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that point has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> George Washington bridge, that I wasn't very much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
And in my humanity, I have tried to improve everything I did.
But my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was looking at things that didn't mind with people I know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my friends, with the people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason why it's <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going on <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, die is not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to be <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a small child.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understand those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was <unk> a miracle, didn't die that day.
And the <unk> was <unk> that was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in a different way.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please be not that -- but imagine, and how do you get <unk>
What is the thing that <unk> that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How can they change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her job influenced me.
I have a design company and animation that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to speak at Tony again.
I just want to communicate with it, and he's able to communicate for me."
And I said, "A second is not that you see Stephen <unk> -- it's not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're somebody important and you have a very good insurance you can't really do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way -- they go marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to happen.
I was obsessed with his brother and his father in that particular moment, "All right, here's the Tony Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research who has a technology that lets them project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and play the negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs then with bad words, then with the bad words, then in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in its <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization moving around the way we had done a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that it could be <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is great!"
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from all walks of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and when they <unk> they would have taken off the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the Chicago <unk> <unk> my son was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we buy on the refrigerator of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
So we took a <unk> camera -- we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and there's one that is free -- we published the <unk> code, software is down in a way for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say.
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to <unk> and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year, two weeks of teaching all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system of your life and is looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he turned to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust out in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I was an <unk>
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a very cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to get them to make it faster and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the guy, and this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up at close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show -- which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it happen.
None of the thing that there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that I feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, whoever is <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in the situations in most of a very dangerous situations and very dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in an <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And it spent 30 days eating just this very funny thing at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, most of my career I've been <unk> in situations in pretty awful appearance with the only goal to try to examine social questions in ways that we have interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and on the content I could do on the face, especially if I put ridiculous into you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity to do.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title of progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I had no longer been able to deal with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be bothered for something that was so difficult or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The greatest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The greatest movie ever <unk> is that everything in the bottom at the bottom, at the end of the end, has images all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk>
But not only are we going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we put all the categories that we could in the film.
You might be <unk> a shoe and it gets back the most cool shoe you ever had.
The most great car that you have to lead in the <unk> movie ever <unk> the best drink you <unk> <unk> from "The greatest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> --       And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the film shot at the beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> I don't <unk> David <unk> How much money does it have to do this?
MS: It's a million and a half million <unk> and John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth getting a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that film is going to look like a lot of <unk> idiots here.
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be protected.
MS: But it will be hard for the film to film or for me.
JK: They both stuff.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I was asking myself, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about the brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he goes, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> media scenario is the idea of the idea with that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake -- and that mistake was this.
Actually it wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: the <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> the president -- even the CEOs at the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to making it really something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that kind of weird bear still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started to talk to the businesses and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want me to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want them to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a child and my father <unk> me in some lie -- and it's him looking at me as used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency wanting to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through the way to go and go to the businesses and I was all my team.
So what I started to see is suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking about companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make great Hollywood movies -- huge <unk> they say that the reason their movies have so much success is because of the markings that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> movies.
And the film is called "The greatest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you with you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for a man like <unk> strong, <unk> <unk> like <unk>
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we have, we are more <unk> a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind us -- to remind people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do you keep doing cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What's a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, the people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Volunteer: revive the '80s, the <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I am worships like sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: On <unk> <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of pets.
We had toy toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: Go! <unk> <unk>
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom but I often put myself on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These shape people do my way to see the world.
A: Tell me from that world.
MS: That world? I believe that your world is the world that we <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come and start in a place and you start in a place and you start in my family, in Virginia Virginia.
A: what is the next one you want to talk?
MS: Next is this is the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and how to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more about you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have <unk>
I don't have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thank you for your patience, <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness for all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your <unk> <unk> brand <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to get into one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear -- and you actually give them a little positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to get your brand, your brand, your brand, what would it be?
You're a <unk> civilization, you are somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or you're a good <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are as being playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> bold or bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or sage -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, you wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie marketing for.
We went to San Paulo where it's forbidden the advertisement to free open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are doing the way in schools with problems of available in the U.S.
And the incredible thing to me is that the projects I've had the greatest answer or the ones I've been most successful are those who I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their donor agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do he gone? Did they get <unk>
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival take a look.
So the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only one of two weeks, a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no television.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to make lead.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk about is giving their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that are pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees at loss of risk is preparing their entire company for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to animate people who are not afraid of opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it a place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name on <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED matrix, the Foundation, Foundation, and the <unk> Foundation for <unk> to be applied for TED for the next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest active to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're entirely different technology.
But if we can put a cash virus from Windows on a portable computer used by an engineer, to set up this gray, that's gray, so we are ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray, <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems of control.
That struck us for the attention, and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment, and we saw what was going on with this.
So they were very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense to me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
Could it be, for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we can see the goal soon.
And so we pulled out the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a little and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the internal data.
They would make all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at first were called the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and the data structures and we tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely an industrial <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because most infection has been <unk>
They don't find many thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called it up and I went into an effort for <unk> his experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate that little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that <unk> inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can be <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> on an effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> by looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts of <unk>
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in their hands.
So it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to <unk>
And yet, we found that both of the digital <unk> to a single and same objective, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We must not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So I'm going to show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really struck me.
That's the gray, and the top is the <unk>
What this thing is doing is to intercept the input values for example, from the pressure sensors and the sensors sensors and it provides <unk> which is still running on the attack, with <unk> <unk>
And believe it or not, these <unk> data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds with video <unk>
It's very <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes on speed, you have to open <unk> valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in an energy plant, or in a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology with <unk>
It was the most possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a lot of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better we have to start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in the other way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be <unk> and that gives you <unk> or another one that will make users of wheelchair get up and walk back to walking.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something you put in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also increases in your speed, and help, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it to the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that on average, you have to take on your back a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to bring it even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries to the back, on 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk> damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 30 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Its flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
What I want to do is, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of lawn chairs about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people sitting at the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with very young people, with the spinal cord that will start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury, or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago had an injury in the column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors ...
We don't have been completely <unk> on the crutches that they send signals to board, here on the back.
There are a few batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and they make it progress with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, ski down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything is moving down to the <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That's 19 years ago.
So I stole me to the last bit of the hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down the bottom of <unk> climb rocks and even riding rocks in a hand.
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not just about soldiers, but to all the users of chairs of the wheels, to all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know about their cousins.
This is the world of <unk> <unk> of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives over their closest lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother, an evolutionary grandmother, which lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by the large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforests and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been alive for decades and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation is making you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos with the bonobos and honestly are not sure of it.
And yet, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes, the love of love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk>
<unk> as humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo watches the roots of the <unk> the same laugh, the dance and the human bias.
The game is the glue that we come together.
I don't know how they play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of only the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I'm not talking about football.
Here is a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos as humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game, like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to be <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, as it were, sometimes we played ourselves, and explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To be successful to a world that changes have to play.
But let's get to the maximum of our own ability.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human people, the life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, they can be the moments in which the most <unk>
And so <unk> <unk> to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the captain in a fire fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers are trained to a highly specialized staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second voluntary in the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But there was still a career on foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that definitely went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> her <unk> his house was on fire.
The other voluntary one that had just gotten before I am, <unk> <unk> --  came to first of the captain and he asked him to go down and would save the dog's house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a burning building to save a live alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to say, <unk> <unk> and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I spent the <unk> firemen that was at that height of the <unk> and he entered the upper room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the wonderful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the house of the house where, as they would expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the <unk> house by the brave new effort to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer protons witness and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage acts of the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who've succeeded, or are in the <unk> of success success -- I'd like to remind you this: <unk>
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have a little bit for giving, <unk> right now.
It was <unk> food in a dining hall, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but each day we're going to influence somebody.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks had been made in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of cement of a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> he came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer, to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
It made it accessible. It made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world over other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block that the transistor allows you to create a lot bigger and more complex circuits a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't place it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> is the stream, and the pink is the wire and the orange color is <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue blue with green and very quickly you can start to make older circuits.
A blue thing with a green is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program it, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more faster or more slowly, it just turns this button that makes your pulse be faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get into building blocks ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar cells, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the children to see them to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light work, or why the door of an elevator stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also carried out to design design schools.
So for example, designers without any online experience begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles, paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
  A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the <unk> School of Rhode Island, that they have no experience in engineering and wood and paper cardboard, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that has fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world that we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and stuff.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment, focus on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I have the time <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some Peace <unk> for <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them to the wild world.
They did big <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
Let's get <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here's what if I would find a date, but what it really looks for is that somebody is caught when he was caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment that was very much last year.
They realized the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that the citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made as a good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
So it has a set of playground.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest <unk> of the 21 applications of the last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads in <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, looking at this app that he was able to use it not for snow, but for citizens to make <unk> <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> of the tsunami, but people <unk>
So she asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just turned out to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we now know about nine cities that we used to use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition of software takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that by the regular channels that would have taken for at least two years and half a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that even the time has gone past 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of shot shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies, like many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> it is open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important app of this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of the government that has new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to make them together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they get crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because alone didn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have left government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask them, because the things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose to choose to make people <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of telephone and information <unk>
It's the place that serves calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the door door to the house, put it very hard and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no phone center.
It has an app and web application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't recognize that app.
It was the job of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually came up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a local.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the partnership of <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think you're the entrance to another.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have I chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will save our values and understand our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 feet.
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word very <unk>
But it's that <unk> which belongs to us that we funded as something that belongs to us as something that operates at our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing the power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy be sexy.
Because it's where the real government work.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism that is <unk>
And for the ones that we have tested ourselves to government, is time for us to ask us what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we can go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't get out of government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of age of our members is about 28 years old, so I am a generation older than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost because of granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk.
They can express their opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care about making their voices.
They're using your hands.
They put their hands into the work to program applications that make applications better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd, or we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED, watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they tell you here have impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you're taught with feeling, you can have a special meaning to do.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the right practice of the right practice -- my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She took a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slavery.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery with <unk> the way we saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little and looked at it, she was approaching me and I was going to give me a good <unk>
And I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> I was approaching me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was going to get me back, and if I said yes, I left me.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at it, and she looked at her, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and she took me out of the hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said to me, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you."
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't hear it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want your mother."
<unk> is my <unk> and you have to be <unk> that always <unk>
As I was <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do is you're always going to do the right thing even though the right thing is.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South rural. I have a brother a year and a senior sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just get to the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No no, no. It's good. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I landed on the click with force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is to think it's a <unk> I'm saying it for the power that has identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the others that they really don't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that they were, according to it, we need to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest disease rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, poor or <unk> finds so much <unk> as well as a particular thing for these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or the parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Los City Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young men in the jail or the parole.
Our system is not only distorted by race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and feel that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what the results are.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not any problems.
We're <unk>
I think it's interesting.
We're looking at our work some good curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you give you out of rights, because you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to <unk>
And if we put it over to the next 10 years the loss of the loss of rights to be so high as it was before it was <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world that became 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without a chance to go out there.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people at death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a sense of sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> but if we deserve to kill them.
This is interesting.
The death row in the United States is defined by mistake.
From every nine people who have been identified has identified one which is <unk> and released from death row.
A mistake, <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is interesting.
In aviation you would not have to be able to never fly airplanes if you could ever be able to run airplanes if you would have nine that would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this thing if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history -- I'm talking about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what he defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you are talking about the people who stop saying that in our history, we deal for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades, race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All the time I was doing with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before we had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany at the death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers were stopped after my presentation and said, "You know it's pretty disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> We don't have death row in Germany.
We would never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way for our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, intentional and <unk> we put ourselves to <unk>
Let's get it on this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these things that really hard, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. It will understand creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate the two things.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
So with creativity. The development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also by the heart of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly humans if we didn't pay it attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to be used to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> and they call me <unk> they come up with the lady <unk> We are going to get together to go.
You want to come and get <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she was like, "Well what are you going to do when we <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk> them.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, think <unk> tell me this idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We tried to end with the sentences of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and he looked at me and he looked at me and said, "Hey, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> exhausted, very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "Is that why you have to be very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belongs to you, not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
And so I think there are basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty, is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> don't judge us by our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not in the way they treat rich, powerful and <unk> but as well as they treat poor, <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to go to jail and I see my 13 <unk> and 14 years that have been <unk> for them to be <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it's not about?
The judge was called it as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night later, I was awake at <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He was a <unk> customer -- a little, black <unk>
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14 years to be treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I found there there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the consumer behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but an entire lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, just not only had it <unk> it was sent to the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the cut for this stupid.
I got up in the car and I felt truly <unk>
I went on the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He walked to the courthouse.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black man, was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up and said, "Who is <unk>
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "That's you. I said yes.
So I came up with me and I <unk>
And I was interested in the ear, on the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That really connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
By the inside, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we started going.
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They got the police. The prosecutors for the <unk>
I suddenly didn't know how, the room was full of people around, and we were going to talk about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I grew up to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would just look at the window and let me hear all that <unk>
I got walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
And for the break a <unk> <unk> I showed it, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran over the old black man.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience room to tell this young man who would keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come today at TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up into justice.
We can't really be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You would hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, from this community, to help your <unk> to do something.
Which is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to me.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to make the funds that are spent in this punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the homicide for homicide in <unk>
The rapes don't get at all.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, the security <unk>
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones who think this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war war.
That's why it comes up with this dramatic increase in the industrialized population.
And we let us convince you for the rhetoric of this punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain, by stealing a bicycle, for little crime crime crime crime crime crimes -- instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
I think our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about this today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats by Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- it could be the last six days or for the last six years.
And the idea is that the media media would be prefer negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are receiving many, many more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of that data is an old piece of time called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So for a <unk> of stories, they would look at the negative ones.
That old saying from the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us a negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be bad at worse.
But maybe it won't.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress conducted in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of water <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
As human beings are very good for us to find out the problems, and in the long, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita for inflation has <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy over 25 percent of more than 80 percent of more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> TV, mobile air, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the past century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and then lately, exponential growth.
My good Kurzweil Ray showed that any tool that you have to think about information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law -- and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer for the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft that is -- in good and bad time, in the war and peace, in a recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually faster and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law -- there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, 3D printing and the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, fuels and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" to <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy play.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students and, in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have a absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every <unk> is about creating a life of what possible.
Is it just about taking it out and make it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon had covered with silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But King of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on Earth, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
And so the tip of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come from <unk>
It's tethered to the oxygen and the <unk>
But then the <unk> came out and made the aluminum thing cheap that we used it as it was <unk>
Let's make this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we used in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 miles of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we have plenty of water.
Let's now talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out of the Voyager Voyager towards the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
It was a famous picture -- how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> point <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, put me permission to get your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water by the day of any source water, saltwater, <unk> water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is just thought to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola is the <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation of this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than the Spanish president, 25 years ago.
And by counting with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than the president Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever been.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video -- images of books and music, diagnostic technology.
Maybe you might get the best to get into your health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Science Foundation, which is something called the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging teams of the world to get these technologies into a mobile device with the ones that talk, and because it has <unk> they can <unk> they can be able to get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the <unk> burden is 25 percent, and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device would be <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the healthcare virus, and first of all, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the highest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection of the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion Internet users.
Three billion of our minds have never been able to do before we get to the global conversation.
What do these people want these people?
What do you say? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
How about the voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
So what do we think about these 3,000 dollars?
And if they are contributions that we can't get <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by his passion with a goal of course, they can do things that were <unk> things that could only do the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They have played with my college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came over and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of pattern recognition of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are interested in to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have for some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may think they would be <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot until the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned very much with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see about <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 miles -- the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so he was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I got to the five centimeters tall.
You have genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing is changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> at the introduction of <unk> fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was going to impose into the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite <unk> he called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in South China, and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture there was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And the majority of the fish are <unk> tiny ones about <unk> the remains of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then it starts the mall.
The bottom of being a soft coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a alive.
I was still not <unk>
They said, <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen have collected every time they have never fish.
But there's no <unk> left.
We didn't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point at a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things -- biodiversity, and a lot of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation using the images to use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and then extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the succession of changes.
And by the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant -- before it is <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
And over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain as a captain could see that a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or generally they don't use the scientists in fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can deliver a protected marine area.
Because with the marine marine zones protected the <unk> we really really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which enables them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were <unk> with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that would give up is this: <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today, we'll see why the videos are made and what the importance has to do.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, they come to come to a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
<unk> over 48 hours of video on YouTube video <unk>
And of those, only a little percentage of the same is a very small percentage of the <unk> and make cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot out of his home in the Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> of the popular summer of the summer.
<unk> didn't prove to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
I had published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> <unk> the <unk>
The trends like Jimmy <unk> is presented with new and interesting things and the <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   You all want you to get the end of the week, the weekend.  KA: On a Friday, KA: Let's not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca <unk> of Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a view of view, and share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great smile internal then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody of each other day.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's the way, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old.
And then it became international.
And all of a sudden, the whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all become part of it.
Because today I'm not just <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or Rebecca <unk>
What do you script might have been written by that <unk>
In a world where two days of video days per minute, only the only one and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have done that.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who was protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you from properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprising effect and its humor, Casey <unk> I made that five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is true for everything new that we make creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend creative communities, creative communities, all of the unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't want permission to express their ideas.
Now we are all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, but they're just the current media, but we can see the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unity and freedom in their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, I am now doing it.
You get into silence.
He died for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to get it, but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years ago when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to be <unk> the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do this.
And then after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was sent into the sea dressed in the sea <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we were <unk> first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are about that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> will dive into every wave, and the horizon is vast and vacuum.
I don't remember pirates who came various times, but they were fooled by the courage of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start to start for six hours.
But I know the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man that collapsed and died, he died, the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class of <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from us.
Unlike the <unk> in the middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the clips of English was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a master's degree, <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and math, and you wouldn't want what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> our grandmother's movements at the house.
My mother had <unk> every ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be <unk>
She opened a computer store and then he studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition, angry and <unk> boys and <unk> were caught between two worlds.
They looked subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> relentless with what I was talking about.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically by violence, abuse of drug and isolation.
But many people received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer they chose to have a young Australian year-old student.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, <unk>
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited me to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in homes whose existence would never have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we got a ship.
He had never been an option.
He said, "What don't you do is not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly talking, more it was <unk> to speak.
And I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up with my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new <unk> in the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily be accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, an optimism <unk> a <unk> mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people who <unk> <unk> cannot be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant <unk> of soup that we all <unk>
<unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but very bright ones, and we opened up a step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After just a journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, there was <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised raised alone.
At 17 he became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause of her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't prove it to be wrong.
He was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died, a thousand miles was <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why her hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people we were and how life made us, we can now see that men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that to you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, you will lose brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that not guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them safe, it would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of the way here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted the <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
So in that time when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior was <unk> he was pulling a bow out and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that blew me up a lot.
Every time I felt a little more <unk>
I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I couldn't get my friends.
I thought that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me their <unk> <unk> in my pocket.
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent you from <unk>
Would our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use for magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books for the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device capable of connecting the readers of the whole world.
Can you know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
They put the text with the image, animation and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, "You know, your fingers on each side.
And so --  -- it says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a few moments I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes to me.
My little girl inside of all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic magic, to those ideas that we teach from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, we light your way in the way the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In the whole book book there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it's also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another extraordinarily important thing to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary content.
This is the <unk> here.
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of replacing for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's children's story.
In a history that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out to the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
And I had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks and <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual that we have to go out and in a chapter, we had a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a photo of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the connection of connection between magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and then through an augmented reality, you see an animated group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and the technology and the technology and the technology come to each other.
We <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients and <unk> and <unk> What do we <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects are not because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob on and water.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple that every time I was <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when I needed <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but it is looking backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers, on Twitter.
So every morning, I would link to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> -- I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing it can happen, because it's pressure of pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to leave smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available to me.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, come back to control and to be captains of their own <unk> but also it can help us care for health care, because of the challenges we face, like the firing of the costs of care, and the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to share it with you with a video video.
We all have sailing checks in the <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM ATMs are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up a <unk> office and they're shut down.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use his wife's cellphone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Whenever you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, can you find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in its place.
Please wake up in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or it's <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography came up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my prior passion for the drawing -- but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera to the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that we started to press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building very <unk>
But it has a unexpected.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful <unk> but with the common goal of maintaining the <unk> level.
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way in photography.
You know, where you have to think about a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to do with capturing an idea that has to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> of light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here is three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems <unk> like it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process when I combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a photo look like this, I think they are not even <unk> the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when you combine the photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will keep to make realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
I think that it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put the ideas in danger the ideas that has in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find out the different locations for the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made the <unk> home at the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic result: I think we need planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures it can be very beautiful and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
So please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder myself.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general part.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this -- like many other people we usually see is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in the scale of performance.
And I'll talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here is something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we look at technology curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if I draw them on a normal curve where, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look like ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you were <unk> for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport transport technology as fast as <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development of economic growth that every few years increased orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- if you look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't have forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's good to become a typical curve, I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's everything that can happen.
I'm optimistic, I think maybe it will happen something like this.
So we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is, what is that new way that you adopt the world?
How new is the world <unk>
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
That happens a transformation, we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition from that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back a couple of two million years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that were <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that we organize these chemicals we give us an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there was some oil <unk> with all kinds of <unk> chemical inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials from the outside and so these droplets grew up grew up there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a chemical distribution of chemicals.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow become better being better at the time of bringing chemical chemists more than we can bring together more chemicals and make them more <unk>
Usually they were more <unk> they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to storing information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to do it.
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code of the common letters that we usually use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy.
But then another big step happened in which things were <unk> very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information and communicate information in the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are very resistant DNA to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came back so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different cell types working together as a living organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or your muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and reported more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more that process information in the community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures for <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn how to eat a certain fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that have been built for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruits of fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures actually accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea to do a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here by emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a very similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
Now that allows us to start working like a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we spent the similar amount of periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing <unk>
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> computer tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to manage that information.
And that brings us together in something much bigger -- faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The language of the language, so they took less than a million years.
And those kinds of electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process was <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something which accelerates their own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without the online online technology.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that each transistor is on that machine of connections.
There are thousands of billion.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that something that does not could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that works on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences for chance?
You could run these sequences at random, <unk> to run all of those programs, and to take those that are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But one, luckily, was able to figure out two numbers in the right order of order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that make the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will bring the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's come back again.
It was some mutations here.
And it tries to try and try and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are telling numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it, to see how they work.
These are dark programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing this.
Once I was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he pulls me up and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than the normal engineers.
However, we don't understand all the options that there is.
In that sense, it is in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can run these programs much more quickly.
So it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our thinking to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time enough to be able to give up some of my fake fake <unk>
Before I treat my talk, let's talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be out of getting <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope a lot of you know about it.
It's called the average <unk>
And we're talking about 300, from a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who is about <unk> to the first base of the base, it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League <unk> of <unk> in more 400 <unk> in a regular season at a regular basis.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or less awkward, after what I'm telling you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are conjunction with a surgeon that has also a record of 400 to <unk>
That's not working, right?
Now assume that they live in a place away and a dear -- has two clogged arteries -- and your family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's really improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think it must be the average of a heart surgeon, or a heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do -- though, is sending them into the world, and they were, with the <unk> of being perfect.
I never, ever would make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a mate in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence at the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin of every artery that comes out of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic -- and often the usual <unk>
And I even knew the control diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if you were going to do everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible thing to do, because so I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the <unk> lady.
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the emergency lady in the emergency room where I was working.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room went to a cardiologist -- I was going to go to that patient.
and to report to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me a heart heart failure.
So in these conditions, the heart stop working, and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are blood blood, and that's why there is difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was going to do.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a little bit of water pills for it, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And it was when I made the first <unk> to send her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent it to his home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring some information out there.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to be <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it to his house, I didn't see attention to a voice in my interior that said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so unsure that he asked the nurse that he would give the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was signed up on high school, and the ambulance along the ambulance with his house.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was in my car to go home. At that point, I did something I don't do normally, at that time.
I went to the emergency emergency service at home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but they said to me three words -- those three words that most emergency doctors have been born.
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In the course of an hour of being arrived at his house, after I was high and her family had been a collapse and his family came to the <unk> the ambulance <unk> brought into a <unk> blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock issue.
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff will put out all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all the hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that I never <unk>
He had a <unk> damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And the ninth day, they let them go. Mrs. <unk>
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks of that, I was excited about it, and I experienced the shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that happened.
And it wasn't my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would love the stuff and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send it to her home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day <unk> he opened the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we put the efforts to be perfect to be perfect for more errors, they would stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, it was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
He pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He <unk> penicillin and sent it to his house.
But while he was running on the door, he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my support shift -- my chief asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a condition potentially fatal called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it is the upper surface, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over and over again.
Two times at the same turn of emergency <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, not sent them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculation of <unk>
It turned out an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out a colleague who was checking the patient to <unk> a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand side, and he called a surgeon in the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read it liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
I looked at it, and when I noticed a certain sensitivity in the bottom right, called the surgeon a surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered very well.
But every case I was obsessed with me.
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get married and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, I had a <unk> in my hospital <unk> and the wrong leg -- I would have a little bit of looking at it to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that not, those who can't sleep, and the ones that have a great outcome and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get out of medicine to people that make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad basketball and medical journalism and learning to learn how possible, since the first paper I wrote to the Toronto "Star until my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, in which one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing havoc and death.
In this country, they die 24 of Canadian medical errors.
The U.S. Medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system, where the knowledge is <unk> every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in the chest, come up with <unk> <unk> and breath alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the same thing.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professionals like error, well, not to stay anyone.
And with how people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, white art, this is my worst <unk> I would say this is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> to go down to your head and <unk> it and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, you don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The military <unk> human <unk> is human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They give the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everybody else.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human, you get mistakes in it.
I feel a lot of effort and effort for learning something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember that.
Do you know how many choices we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick an American American, they're about 70 a day.
Not very much, on a research on a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> by these executives and time that they are doing decisions with age-related decisions.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job involved very many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
12 percent required for an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
You know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do they apply those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and a few solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, at Stanford University, this very <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and collected over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and some 25 water water, and this was when we took water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I wondered, why never I buy anything?
This is the shelf <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to go to the manager and asked him to get this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to the buses full of tourists that would come every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
I had a put in <unk> right to the retail store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors of 24 different flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop <unk>
More people stopped when there were <unk> 60 percent, when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here is the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when there was only three three got to buy <unk>
When there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six than if they found 24.
Well, let me decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have <unk> <unk> less is good to conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the decisions about savings for retirement of a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of annual funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two, up to different ways.
We found that the bigger the number of mutual funds had less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in plans for two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that <unk> about 60 funds, the rate of involvement on the 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of options, more people will be able to avoid equity or hedge funds.
As far as there was more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences, the more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decision, the <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest of interest.
They are more likely to take the worse decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things, even though they actually get it better.
The main reason is that we are looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, <unk> and choosing that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have focused on one form or another, in different research, so that you can test out in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of <unk> choices -- there will be a <unk> increase in <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate <unk> eliminated the products to move from cats that are less than <unk> the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and under costs.
You know that there is the bill of today, on average they have 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store you have about 100,000 products.
But the nine bigger store in the world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato guy.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that they have emerged about how to manage the choices is the cartoon of David <unk> the Harvard show.
All the Harvard employees are automatically agreed to a safe insurance fund.
Those who are really willing to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know how often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford to be able to do them either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with everything paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really did hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, than the second trial, but I can tell you what they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people understand differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And I was that meeting exactly how it was <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we found was that we would give the staff to think about the positive things that they would have to do in their lives if they were to save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can manage more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine corridor of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket supermarket <unk> along the corridor of the <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of different <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
So these are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and another <unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that they <unk> not as the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than what we think, if you just shake it a little bit.
We need to increase economic complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a car manufacturer of cars that allow us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions.
I have <unk> outside of the car.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is actually <unk> the order of making the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, a few times.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?
What do you feel about?
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of other options are going to <unk> the <unk> button and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they keep there.
Same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of the order of information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of the change box does not say anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways that they would make you choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I have talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> you know, <unk> <unk> alternate <unk> -- we can do it <unk> we can manage more categories of less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business or for people who work.
So I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful <unk>
And the more careful you are in our choices we can actually practice the art of choose.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in East East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter <unk> to the government.
I had to record a piece of text text with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written written with the wrong message they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would be <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color laser printer and print a page, that page will end up having a little piece of printed printed on every page that follows a pattern that makes them yourself from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the net.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amounts.
There are really a lot of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal media to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The secret secret in the U.S., two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> They don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us will be a victim of a <unk> that in real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, and the protests, they motivate them, <unk> <unk> laughter.
Groups as Anonymous has <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group of the United States are the United Nations, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an unelected authority of the Netherlands or actually it was.
It was <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
It <unk> the security of the site and run a <unk>
Last week I asked, I said, at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> the death of people who are caused by the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a suicide attack.
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we have <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> an Afghan foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters at the headquarters of the secret secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the government.
The company <unk> is right here.
You know, Western government -- they provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western government is also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government government to research their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It will be <unk> to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the media, and to listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do that.
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, be forever.
Do we vote in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in South Park.
These are cows in my dad, the bottom, and behind the cows, the Yellowstone National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has nothing in the largest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead because I was the only bull that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value them.
So I grew up <unk> <unk>
The dying are warriors protect our community and livestock and they also are angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, in the age of nine to the nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing as I was going on me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually it wasn't <unk> because it even helped the lions see the pen a way away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they saw the <unk> and the second day, and they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come.
And I found that lions are afraid of the light that it moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with what we will turn and turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks up the battery and the battery battery in the small box. I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> they get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come at night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions so that I am walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never came back to have lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, so frightening to other predators like Marie <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants from their farms.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up lights on the houses that don't have them, and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in meadows of the <unk> <unk> cows in my father, and I used to see flying planes and said it would someday be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be a aviation engineer, and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows in my father and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to listen to a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric fence -- one near <unk>
<unk> I know that electrical fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I put it back once, right? I have tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: At the <unk> --  CA: At the <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would have all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
But sometimes I wonder about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
I said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
He was very altered.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child on her arms and watching his mother face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived grass, eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequently than the control of energy, everything around it was completely dark, at the night except by the sea lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo of North Korea on the night compared with the American countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, you see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like Afghan <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not only extremely hard, but also dangerous, because refugee refugees in China were considered illegal migrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of around North Korea.
A days -- my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> so I was <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they made a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought that my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a mate told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seeking asylum.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Though the <unk> had eventually been released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can get it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life over again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between Northern and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
I had not a country I could call my pride with mine.
Even though I was going to live in South Korea in South Korea -- it wasn't easy, I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities <unk> some money that sent my family, and as punishment my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee it immediately.
So I started planning how to make them run.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then over Southeast Asia.
I took a week, and we had almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the story of all of us and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, and I was standing and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month month ago.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the <unk>
This was one of the most low dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at the window of South Korean embassy away.
I was going to come up with the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family, to my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask me, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I took it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I tell me?"
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> new hope for me and for the village <unk> when more they <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> it needs the <unk>
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or none of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices language practice practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with religion, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including the TED scenario.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> bamboo <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Central Center to represent something else, so they changed to the South Los Angeles as if this is what is really wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.   <unk> of <unk> fast food <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles South Center for the home of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to carry kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases, in Los Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I was excited to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs of flashy wheels and sold as self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of managing 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land strip that we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to use it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green -- we put us together, and we started planting our food forest food, trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do -- we are a kind of paid group of <unk> of all the <unk> of the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
And the city looked at me and at <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
An order for planting the plant to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I had even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's time enough to plant <unk> million plants.
Why on earth does not look like this?
We had a plant to give a thousand seed <unk>
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, I grew up there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Just like an artist artist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if you stop that canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became an education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
They are <unk> to see how it affects guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> and thought that you can do, especially in a <unk>
They get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came to a mother and his daughter, who was like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this that way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I really shame when I see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why do I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't tell me that people are going to steal your <unk>
I mean, I said, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
It's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at your time, I want you to get his <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a bomb shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> every single volunteer.
If the kids grow up, kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how the food affects the mind and your body, eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're wondering: I see color kids that are on this path that is designed for them, that leads them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who were <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's funny about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, to get the kids out of the streets, who know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, opening markets the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You take them to take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Come on, thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --  <unk> from the <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very respected road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as it rains, so hard.
You can have a huge amount of water on the asphalt that they <unk>
And especially if you go on your bicycle and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a silent <unk>
So the solution for that is to do roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the rain water flow goes down on the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't have any water to be <unk>
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road rocks <unk>
First one stone, then a number more and more and more and more, and so forth, and <unk> well, don't do that.  But they can harm their <unk> and you're not going to be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see what damage is in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of the light, the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you're <unk> you're going to be <unk> and you get rid of the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material off, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to make it a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel shift, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks <unk> back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here on the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> in which we had to make a test lane to test this stuff.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples of this road and we tested it in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of charges in them, we put a lot of charges into them, the strength then with our <unk> machine and the ours and we put it back to it.
We can do this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fiber of steel, incorporating these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the life of the road, you can even double the life of the surface of the road, it will actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity that it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's quite hot.
Actually, it has to cool first before I can show you how it acts the flesh.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having me a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news generally was <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what I did -- but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was struck as a kid to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we were two to <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where it is.
We had to hide the books in a market bags, so that we were going shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, a teacher, students and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly closed a day for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go?
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. It was that his daughter, my mother, to the school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It leaves two years ago, just to turn our home into school for girls in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want to not <unk>
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school to <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just stop my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I've been driving it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite them, despite them, even in front of a <unk> opposition.
As a <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally they escaped out of being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When I got to his house, they get a voice a voice <unk> if he was still sending his daughter to school, they would come to try.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but we don't harm the future of my daughter for their old and <unk>
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school are <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so that these changes didn't last too long, after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls in the <unk> I <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never I've ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a very revolutionary <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution broke inspired by the combination of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the 1970s <unk> each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a set of courage to the <unk> <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 people dead -- we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure -- culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have asked a lot of other women, to rebuild the civil civil society, <unk> a financial transition and fair to democracy and national reconciliation,
It was set up about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we started the <unk> of women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women leaders, and <unk> orientation leaders, to advocate for <unk> autonomy of women and for our right to participatory participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won an <unk> from the National Congress in 52 years.
However, little to little, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we were news about violence.
One day we wake up with the news of <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we wake up with the news of the official murder of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the <unk> and their legal, human rights violations.
Our society, made up for a revolutionary mindset -- and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
It stopped the <unk> and the revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all in order to deal with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Rather, I am here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the election didn't put the peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> they brought peace and reconciliation reconciliation and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society continues to <unk> and dominated with selfish networks of domination and <unk> both for men like <unk>
Maybe what it was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the elections, which is only <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs the representation of the female representation of the most of the women who will need the representation, and we need to get it out of it.
We need to stop acting as an honor agents and to call a days of anger.
We need to begin to act as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but it also puts in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that the Libya, <unk> the war, desperately desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God's <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions, has the same root as the word <unk> <unk> feminine and <unk> that spans the entire humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion spread all of existence.
And so he said, "My mercy is <unk>
And this is what he was like, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That will all be given to you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a sovereign question, which has an equally matter response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to look at is the ones that everyone does. Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. He had had a <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American American American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, I who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> at the University of Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for high-speed companies, <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I'm about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, every races, all of the income, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> <unk> and long duration of the other way, in families -- the last place that we want or we would expect to find a reason for which, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who sticks, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls who are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night at January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a <unk> college <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and that looked like a field of the field.
He had a little bit of big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it on everything at the beginning, <unk>
We started out and loved all of me, who was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who was a passion to help girls, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as a woman had ever done it.
And it was so that the <unk> of that <unk> and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I just left my job and <unk> and I went back in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was in the head of a physical, financial trap and psychological psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat to violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept her underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said it needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived smaller.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted up my hand, my life was very serious at every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 megawatts of my neck had disappeared, put my mother suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we were living happily to live forever, because I loved him with a lot of a great thing.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply very <unk> for the wedding and for the fact that they form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never do harm.
I spent two times more on our <unk> moon.
The first time I was driving up into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head that <unk> various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving around our moon moon was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> followed by one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help rent to their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why didn't you bother me, I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we have the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim will end the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, and <unk> of financial resources, and the family system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not <unk>
I was able to go, because of an last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, I would have killed if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told you all the world to the police, the police, my friends and family and family, and I am here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims of the victims of <unk> <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people it's a way to say "The guilt is <unk> as if the victims of <unk> were intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> that they learned a lesson from what happened to them and that they <unk> their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that actually I am a victim and a very typical of domestic domestic violence.
I got married with an old man and kind of thing and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to be going back to have ever more, was there never, ever to be able to get my head into the hands of someone who says she wants.
At this moment, the same thing is thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid is <unk> but all this time, I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there is a few people that are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love to be <unk>
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse is only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need to do all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They had the abuse of the light to the light talking about it with their kids, their classmates and family and family.
It was <unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years now.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed me like this.  For luck, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so I don't do anything as I cover my mind.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that's not both like this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what I thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would take my back and get the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery, or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this scenario because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always go, a <unk> was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're asking what is <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry -- which we are biologically programmed for <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I have known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that <unk> Stop. So they're <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we knew so much about models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York said all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then what I would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a brave surgeon and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this really spectacular list, I'm still sorry, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the chief of <unk> the American <unk> or the executive executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model like saying you want to win the lottery when you are older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to prove to you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, one time you can see your studies, and you have a copy of your studies, and you have a copy of your age, you don't matter what you <unk> I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you have the <unk> of underwear inside for 10 years, people would look very rare.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're going into the personal domain, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
I'm in a <unk> party, a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and on <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> from a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people in <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, let's do things for free?
I have too many <unk> heel. I have to use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and the ones that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to take a money, and they gave me the free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red <unk> and, of course, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, not because I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their mind to look like who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year from the <unk> teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young black men in New York, so for them, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk> and <unk>
But how many times are I <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit smaller, and you have the most bright hair, you're going to feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people.
And that's just a part of what happens, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself to ask, with a more thin legs and the most brilliant hair, to be happier?
They only have to meet with a group group, because they have the most <unk> legs of the <unk> and the <unk> and the more of the <unk> but it's probably the physically insecure <unk> on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to retain about this talk, I hope that everyone feels more comfortable with the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough to hold a camera, but today, I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go to me the <unk>
There was no Japanese directors and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very careful <unk>
In fact, most of them took them a random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
And the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, "Why don't you take me to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to happen to us that they were going to get us.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a little girl would be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time on a week of October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we put the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see the life through his eyes, and how it perceives and interact with it.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking around, when all of a sudden it stopped dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the metal store that you would have seen earlier in <unk>
And he described to me what had felt to the five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with force by the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't get back to somebody and asked, "Is it out of a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs <unk> as <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, laughter, applause and <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean the environment,  <unk> are not helping prevent disease <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There's the <unk> of the New World that are primarily in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they <unk> they're important, and first of all, they provide life ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
They took the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill the anthrax they help to absorb the anthrax that it will not be caused by them, and it caused great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historically important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the judgment and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the <unk>
In the mythology of mythology -- <unk> was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood or <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are on the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India as India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs to <unk> the number of drugs has risen enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a terrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so it will focus on a serious problem at all.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them flying without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young <unk> but I am not at the same --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa Rica Coast and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
It was <unk> the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of all, everything that we would expect.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few people decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got the seed seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local food tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, the people were not at all interested in doing that, because what they would tell you about to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were aware that the local people, in such fertile valley, had no agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."   <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato chicken, in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it all --  and we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."  So why don't you get it? You're never going to be <unk>
I thought that only we were doing errors in mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they did, what they did, what they did and then see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the harm that the money has <unk>
He just read his book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root root which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of any different culture as if I were my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face "The Little little is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just answer the age of the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever lose anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it do to you? <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it feels like people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell the people what to do, why not for once, for once, but not in meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they identified.
So planning is this blind one.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't come to their public meetings.
What do we do -- we work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor for company, the family doctor of business, the family doctor who sets up with you in your house, at the kitchen table in your kitchen table, and it helps to find the resources to transform their passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this crease garbage that we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 on the march, and the government came to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so --   So --  So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk> -- we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business <unk> in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
Innovation is the kiss of the death of the business of the corporate spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you any <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic in the <unk> and then they will come out, they will come in the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you about you have to get more of this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossil revolution and a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we see <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a research magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> he got together this group of people, and I thought about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not exist, within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to moving the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk>  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we <unk> life in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came to <unk> anonymous manufacturers companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there was very few hundred factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you."
Otherwise you're not going to talk to you with you.
Then, you have to offer any absolute <unk> <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the larger, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things like that, you have to be fantastic, you have to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can make, selling and find money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
Never the word I, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in <unk> along with their comrades who will do for you, what someone did for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what will it take?
What can you? Can you do it?
Okay, you can get it. Can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Tell you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who are around us can help us make a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't buy a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay for more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our own needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giants of the giant <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
I always <unk> the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the most <unk> military properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and she was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this was a profound gratitude for time and lived for time.
He gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let me keep this look at my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to be able to catch up the day and to forget what really important to one.
So with the help of old people and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted about her sentences for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died, I want to be on a <unk>  "Before he died, I want to sit on <unk> in the workplace.
Before he died, I want to sing to millions of people."
Before he died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before he died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before he died, I want to <unk> it once more."
Before he died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they made me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we made a kit and now have been made up in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions that are increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we're going to prepare for death is one of those things that are given to us more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can be able to reflect better what we care as individuals and as community and more media to share hope and stories and stories, the people around us, not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very <unk>
It's not talking about, but it's transmitting joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
You have it <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice on it: never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words that I couldn't even be <unk> I could remind me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's a lot. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk>
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I was my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would be able to pee my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the <unk> concept of society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- although you didn't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different form of a different way, from there to make it very different in Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I wish I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of you are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your interior and, frankly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change in the moment we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> at the country of <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a professor of communications, who gave a kind of communication to students in engineering.
He was afraid.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when you develop those conversations -- I felt what <unk> had felt when he fell through the hole in the rabbit and saw the door to a new world.
Just so I felt when I had those conversations with the students with the students that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges from energy to the environment and health care -- among others, and if we don't know how we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists as scientists have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as to make them dumb <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein said, which is everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is using examples, stories and analogies are ways of hook and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do the <unk> kill, <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's too <unk> in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that inspired the only design of the unique <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if it loses a little bit, and then providing graphics that we prescribe our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding what is <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of wonders and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words across the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> publisher of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks an public charge game, and then when he wins, she gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced by <unk>
He threw him in the <unk> Tower and <unk> but he had enough of the courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
It was introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, <unk> <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the world."
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody has got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want me that Washington would fall from power.
They didn't want to call him King if he was giving him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more insignificant and more unfortunate <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was CEOs of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate was <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a title as ridiculous as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President's title.
President Barack Obama was lucky to continue there, waiting for the Senate to <unk>
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that the measure is <unk>  <unk> you can keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the President of President of the United States doesn't sound at all that modest today, right?
On everything if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
And the reality and history have <unk> the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, -- the appearance of it, well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the <unk> nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they now are President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changes the words that we could change the reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at <unk> in a <unk> mine.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and rocks <unk> with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap light cheapest light lantern and he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I suddenly remember my hand and suddenly I remember a mining that I met before, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in that hole in that hole in that hole and risk their lives without any pays and reward, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably won't.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is engaged in modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world but not to the grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I was really sad to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
In some, it was even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the population of Africans displaced during the whole of slave slaves in the world.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk> <unk>
However, you can get entire families out by generations per capita debt, from 18.
Amazingly, slavery is profit for more of <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promises of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat and can't escape.
Now, slavery today operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves -- they have value, but those who produce them are disposable disposable them.
The slavery exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal to all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This <unk> and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, <unk> entire families -- <unk> mechanically ventilated families in their heads to 18 at their head, and they bring them from the <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to eat, and the severe <unk> and the severe <unk> was so <unk>
And so <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too <unk> when I got to touch it and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to get it, and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera receives a much better treatment than these people.
On the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that it is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizen in that country.
I could put it in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for the liberation and he trusted what it was <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying rocks for miles per <unk> into the trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who put the charge and the children put them on their heads with leg straps made from <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves and work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, they <unk> them completely their homes.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, told me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> and women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a <unk> stairs that gave this dirty basement of <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> like it's known in craft, they're local to force prostitution.
They have small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every single place is dark and dirty and identified by a number that was painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their hands of their clients.
In the <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be caught up in the hell.
He just had a <unk> the stairs where I came from.
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a subject that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often associate with the labor of labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were Indian families in the trade of silk <unk>
This is a family photograph.
<unk> hands are the father of the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, to be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest <unk> lake in the world.
When we got there, I got a quick look at this.
I saw what seemed to be a team of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some more young children, some of the more young kids, it makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work with extensive <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
<unk> branches in the trees <unk> in the <unk> Lake often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they're thrown into water to unlock branches.
A lot of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they went to the last networks, but they had been working from the last one.
<unk> and <unk>
And it's going to point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge in which we <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk> as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partnerships with partners of <unk> the <unk> a <unk> who was suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and touched the window.
And he asked us to do it for a dirt road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were going to get out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out that the path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started to go off, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the way I ended up in a clear mass of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped to their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in water <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours.
<unk> have to 90 meters, and these people carry heavy heavy bags that then they will be shipped out heavy stone bags that they would be shipped to another area where they took the stone to get the gold.
At the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look over close to the margin -- we see the other lucky ones and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his father to work with him in mines.
By death of the die of his uncle, we had to sell it the debt of the uncle that force it to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines 14 and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he was able to be liberated and educated <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in face to a remote possibility, which inspires me much respect.
I want to drop light on <unk>
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will have testimony of them and do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves some other as humans, then it's very difficult to be <unk> like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. These are real people, like you and real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's not one day that will happen that I don't think about these many beautiful people, I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns a fire on a fire, and that <unk> light on the slavery of slavery about because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied mathematics -- and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like management jobs.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we will see later on.
But the <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain <unk> <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability as well as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at his time, was a <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years, it's been made very much progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to use it to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective and ultimately the only way we know if you really have a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, so they're not biological analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic doing it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
So that would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could make their test <unk>
You wouldn't need to personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do, as a conventional form for a try, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits the sounds of a <unk> <unk> because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of the genes that we need to have the <unk> for example.
And as the <unk> requires a pretty extraordinary training.
Think about the time that leads to a child to learn how to speak.
As the sound of the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as well as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of vibrating ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams in the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
These are both accurate. Well, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, they have about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
So these are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the patient's difficulties with patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do this massive mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So when we give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's, he can call it under the price and put it for a few cents. And I'm very pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So we <unk> taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who not?
What would you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate if you have no disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances are important because we are looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: They have an precision <unk> at this moment?
A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network as well, what we did is the project, now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in no windows and we usually avoid the solar light.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect skin -- we do the impossible and focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that would happen in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was the place working as a part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages was affected by wave.
The water level has achieved more than 24 feet tall and over three miles inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> debris and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and we leave the houses on it to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
And for weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors -- they found similar things.
They found pictures and rubber pictures and chambers and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of peoples around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms -- enormous, enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to come up with me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was moving my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some of you were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got very lucky pictures, and they got more <unk> so I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
So after two weeks I had 150 people <unk> <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would give <unk> a village in the north of <unk>
Once a week we used our scanner in the libraries of the libraries had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
She could take an hour. I could take a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> got to be drawing pretty much by hand using <unk> the areas that the color and detail that the water was not destroyed.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures -- <unk> water with algae -- with algae -- even oil, all of it along with the step of time I continue to stand up, so <unk> was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless they were clean up, and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was really lucky to the photos.
I had started to <unk> it was just stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face would not be able to reconstruct it, we were able to put the images into a single photo and <unk> the full picture.
When they picked their pictures with some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in water.
It took a week to find his family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her photos his child under 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could ever see -- something that he could remember from the past that I could remember from the past that had not been marked on the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, and hundreds of them had joined there, and hundreds of them helped us clean up, more <unk> photographs, great <unk> -- the great majority of their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring to 90 families hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> in teams and materials, most of the ink <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A photo is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would have to ask us, but the first thing they would take to look for.
This is the project to restore little bits of humanity, of bringing up their connection to the past.
When a photo like this comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person who get in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger to bring something, using their talent for something that is not very simple skin model.
To finish the end I would like to read this electronic email -- I sent it on the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a photo with women in different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a very similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mom, and my newborn daughter hangs off our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are <unk> right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us inspired and curiosity with this photo of a bullet that goes through an apple exhibition on a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in the slow motion of the light moving.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it into it and <unk> it in a <unk> of a second or it is, in various <unk> create a package of photons and just a millimeter size.
And that package of photons and that package will travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons spread into this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember that all of this is actually in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going to be <unk> and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights on the bottle, you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually a year.
It would be a very boring movie -- from a moving <unk>
And what about how to try with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a broad composition of it.
But if you look at one more time -- what do you realize that, as the light comes out of the <unk> it is still bright. It's not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato tomato is <unk> and the light bounces off its interior and it goes back and then it goes back from several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on your cell phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at the MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of the exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just go into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those things in crude and put them in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future will allow him to look after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the front door, you will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
So where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera but interestingly, in moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique leaders.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what point it is a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture in frequency, which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
We can see that <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on on the curve, which is <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that could be able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood that's quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new framework of visualization to solving the problems of studying the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became art -- a art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect every time is not just for scientific <unk> but we can see it.
We create a new form of computational <unk> with the slow camera and color codes.
And let's look at those <unk> remember, the time between each of those waves is just a couple of a second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you're going to leave it from us.
The waves should move toward us.
What is going on here?
It turns out that, like we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of events happen in the world sometimes is happening to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can save you, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, put it out and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
Here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people who are <unk> looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who of you have got a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my cell phone, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 I presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European company -- every single Internet vendor of all of Europe, has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends you a <unk>
And if we use your mobile phone where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or their Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information on us.
There were lawyers, <unk> priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, "You know, <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police in Germany in East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Whenever I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we'll give you this information.
At the end, I <unk>
You get the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand people and five thousand people, 30 lines of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge <unk>
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I go by, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk> <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open City City did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can go up and butt out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she called me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one is called the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big network of communications.
You can see how your people communicate with each other and what time they call each other to your sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who you send you an email to whom, is all possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, it would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want businesses to store as much information as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not just fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones that give them to remind you that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I put my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we <unk> all the time.

It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one would give my mother -- my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that I came up with birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you to stand there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish you have been disabled.
Go for a ride.
<unk> at Christmas, are in the commercial mall, drive in circles looking for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the C. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Muslim <unk> a woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and the disease had the same starting first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home home to New York, I can do it.
Many people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the shouldn't, you don't believe in the shouldn't, however.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help me do it <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk>
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at the five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it out.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arabic, and they keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians thought appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a slogan <unk>
The people that I grew up didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of a lot to die of starvation during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating a whole eat, so I stopped dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends went to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we weren't going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were interested in <unk>
On the summer vacation I was often about <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I would give me warm cups on the back, I would put me warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I could not stand up with me <unk>
And now I can put it on your head.
My parents -- this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive action and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, the University of Arizona, because I walked into all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
And I would all tell me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I got the ultimate note in my own lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "When I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of it, I was finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying crying out historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her, why and she told me that because they thought I could not do the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunts -- not the <unk>
It was a paper that I was literally born and gave it to an expert without cerebral <unk>
College was doing my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled papers.
At I I'd come back home, and my first tour <unk> was as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
But instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the operators of <unk> actors were not white, <unk>
It just <unk> perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I did <unk>
On my first tour, he took him famous comics in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first sentence that he took when he fell into the realization that I was going at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in clubs. And also in Arabic in the Middle East, and no censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little nasty <unk> that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was asking for me to ask the news program back with Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a graduate dance, I went to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I went on to the desk desk to not go out on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like <unk> full-time and hitting my chair.
It's a fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The children are <unk> but they never get away from me and no girl not older.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online -- like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> terrorist.
What do you have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> <unk> even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
Kids are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors say not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think I was going to be <unk>
I hope that we can create more positive images of disability in the media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need a whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
I was going to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> <unk> Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give kids Palestinians Palestinians -- a little bit of what my parents love me.
It was the only time my father saw me <unk> and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a young young people.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a little South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a little village to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
Without it to him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no work, there are no work in future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day he was about a guy who offered him to <unk> after dinner <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothing -- money to send a home to your family.
They show a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That child of that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a corrupt organization with the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came back.
This was the first thing that got him out of what we call the <unk>
And his story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the history of the <unk> young unemployed urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that have the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years old.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't care about opportunities, the history of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to the <unk> to be the history of 2.0.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people is <unk>
70 percent of you don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital where I was born.
I remember being faced with that hospital hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I was forced forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a juvenile leaders at a business stage.
It was going to be about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a graduate college graduate student, frustrated, it was the perfect blank whites for <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to the point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who were normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this thing do differently?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit -- and I believe that the business spirit may be the most powerful tool for <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so often.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of private initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from the abroad.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding by creating gardens in the houses, and the companies in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, you can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So then inspiring young people and create a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need a capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation and guidance in development and set up in their businesses.
<unk> to young people with the resources that they need, and they need to share the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
To me, the spirit spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park. This is how it calls it when it is created, and it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the bike for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to convert young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a <unk> Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four feet with the apple hearts with <unk> <unk> balls, and <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> he was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question went with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> cleans our junk -- the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I interviewed around the pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more <unk>
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I am <unk>
And we operated the mechanical covers and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege, and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as much as you believe -- and in the days when it's very strong -- you're going to go very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of trash every day.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of hyperbolic <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and moving into traffic all day and pass across around you.
You just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap is also full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It must always be moving.
And the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important work of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first license to public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective way every day, this starts to get rid of their containers and their dangers are being threaten us in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have room for the new thing for what the engines of the economy start to fail when it is in endangered people.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out its relationship.
And then there is what I call our average average rate that we need.
And so I mean the speed of the speed we used to move in <unk>
We usually don't care about it, and we have to embrace it for us, our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of coffee, our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that is going to take care of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And his job allows us to do our own.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
On the day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> collection on the street, I grabbed my little son, and he went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate waste and went back to that man.
It's called <unk> We worked together many times and made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all costs, even the costs, even the cost of the real labor of play.
The municipal waste -- what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the entire nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, and you get a moment to <unk>
I got a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the ultimate play.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center of a few floors in the capital of the capital of Global Francisco <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty and very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth of a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the ancient market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought that that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the site, the site that is located in a lot of a lot of growth growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see now in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting together all the entries in the building.
And it spreads with a <unk> cheaper that creates an outdoor space in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied to the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every ground because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would fit the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of concrete <unk> to allow the air air to allow the air to air and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have fractal geometry and it helped me to model it.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a very controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what I <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center -- because in order there was more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was very much, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, that they collect water for the inner <unk>
They're waiting for the early next year, because we go through the fifth ground floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a project so big, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a twelve gates of access connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we made was broaden the streets to create 12 initial blocks that are similar to size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the tiny cell project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So you know, a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the <unk> plant.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community that occupied space for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can climb and <unk> and make activities like running a race for a race of two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changing communities and local economies at the same rate that will grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and you have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a small <unk> of <unk> cute. was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up with the year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon and hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher to grades.
And then, I did.
I had the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the things --  And I signed up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes too.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and I just put a row out of that, just for being there, because I am."
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good about it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I would never tell me.
But above all, I was excited about the reason I bothered with this little girl that was so small, it was so good for <unk>
I was overwhelmed with jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading of reading the secondary school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't be <unk> or <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy I know it's fashionable -- I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, it almost has all of them.
This year is now 100 years of his work, "In search of the <unk> the most <unk> study of the <unk> and also the ordinary study of the ordinary man, and the whole thing that we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We thought about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the jealousy that the jealousy you cut to the person, to their desire, they are a <unk> narrative of <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details were going to do to put the black <unk> right?
<unk> do all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure you could pleasure pleasure in the other, maybe now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> cool thing that <unk> detects in his lover would add it to his collection of instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great piles of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links the <unk> language with jealousy.
When you <unk> it is at the agony of jealousy, it will soon listen behind the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than an ancient text interpretation or to look at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> see <unk> and they make them seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful, the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who you need, that makes us feel, it causes us to be a range of feelings much deeper and vital than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal us to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There is some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife's wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or no <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are doing with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we are, the more we are able to make ourselves in a fantasy residents.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead to violent or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about it for eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
One woman of Michigan was captured by 52 years old was actually captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since they would send some awful message to themselves, for a year.
It was a year for a year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What huge big -- even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
As a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of the camps, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take out of your being and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the ground floor, your name, it carries your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as well as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live at jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when they are before a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and asking for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always gotten <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but so on.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of six <unk> once they come in, <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to get your hands on <unk>
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> in history, I find this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated like <unk> like a geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
At the next minute they are the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being he <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that it happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It's just the <unk> <unk>
The fiction used to be <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what I <unk> sweet <unk> the scary one, Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel <unk>
We're in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and above the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the majority of peace in the American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 million dollars of today, or four billion dollars of today, or four billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo did work for about 400,000 people and asked for collaboration with 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of which Muslims behind the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So, why do we care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 miles later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common lives.
Why do we <unk> The cynics answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> -- some ask, why did the <unk>
Why do we turn it in our goal?
And they could also ask, why would I climb up the most <unk>
So 35 years ago, why do we fly over the <unk>
Why do I play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> <unk> was not just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long, technology's list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and the airplane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> was <unk> and we eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to be having what Alvin <unk> <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with sail, but in 1969, the crew of the Apollo 10 flew over 40,000 miles / <unk> hour.
Since 1970, no human being has returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the magic <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that the technology is going to be used as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population -- seem to have been <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube <unk> from the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that has occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> it has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It looks like if the technologists would have found us and they'd been enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious businesses that were <unk> at Intel -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, incentives that venture capitalists offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by the creation of ideas -- by the funding of <unk> ideas -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were in their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred <unk> little investments that they could leave in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a massive capital and whose development is a long term -- also not have invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems, because they don't have any sustainable sustainable value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deeper and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we get <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would take a political decision that was popular and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't fix the big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption is from sources of renewable energy as solar power, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar energy and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy to be able to compete at price.
Now technologists, technologists, and the economists and economists agree on what policies and international <unk> development is developing a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an American energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the great problems that seem like technological, they are not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can do things like crops or systems for the storage and food systems, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon announced the war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are lots of cancer types, some very resilient to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we cannot solve the problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like as a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition -- like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the difficult and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon to be simple.
It was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I can bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions, and there could be increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of opinion, and the opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there is no evidence of that.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political and still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, are still quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But this is really enough?
What the record polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people appear when people are asking certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
I'm probably going to ask the question: "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you have said your question, "Well, I trust some of a few no."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put confidence.
We don't assume that the level of the confidence that we're going to feel for a certain guy in the official said, official or somebody else is going to be uniform in all cases.
I might, for example, say I trust a certain grade teacher that I know to give the type of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I believe that surveys very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to get the good judgment of the way to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
That's not the goal that I <unk>
I would give you more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, that's OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but the trustworthiness.
What is this is to make a judgment of how much people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if on the contrary, they're not allowed to trust them.
I have friends that are <unk> and honest, but they don't get them in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they will be <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very excited to say that I think I don't have many friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to talk before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we have tried to build accountability accountability for all sorts of institutions for all sorts of institutions, and government and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> going on <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and they <unk> that the <unk> system that is destined to secure the <unk> and the testing tests are actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I must have all of you have the similar examples of that.
We did all that, by the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are going to be worthy of being trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> the <unk> which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
You get to the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things on the other way.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because they give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford to keep all the people all the time.
But you also have to make sure that you're worthy of confidence.
How do we do it?
That's a day, everywhere, it does the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks is said I can <unk> without giving any explanations out.
You take them and get it back money, or they change the color of the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing at is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is to relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of the computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world on the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone down, increasingly, and more and more, to such a point today that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that breaks into digital space, so that when the strong breeze against the screen transfers your physical body to the pixel itself.
Designers can bring their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool the barriers.
But two hands stay still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole <unk>
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
It <unk> a transparent <unk> bombsight in the bottom of the fingers and the face, and now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get into the inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in the real space, <unk> is as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and try to measure the book and try to play the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and science on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical ways that we can be <unk> and <unk>
How would a future be like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel anymore.
This magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, the object, the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and go back and stay in the physical world.
You can teach you physically, and the famous and famous shot, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike <unk> or the <unk> books, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what is more fascinating that to change the physical part of the computer is to figure out how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get us out of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you cut that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was fascinated to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to be <unk> to a school for all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a way to close up to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer an American opera,
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I was even writing to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends love me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
I thought that for the rest of my life -- a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one in my all wanted to <unk> OK.
He went back to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books going on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> comes Chinese <unk>
And it's not <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but you know.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture that was also given a place to my reading <unk>
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research research as literature and literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started to read books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual and spiritual.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- rather than lost the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, is through the translation that I realized that Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be going to feel like <unk> or never <unk>
Having an <unk> dream is not compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where the passion comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled couch on the couch, of my office and <unk> the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My classroom had a <unk> like first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> made me easy only to move the head while they would make the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and what I looked at was right.
You start to work after, it has children later, and it has children after death goes on.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> propelled me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with the guys under their category -- he was <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe you get away with the next.
And also, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but it didn't make them <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
So this made them from Alex to the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of benign exuberance was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh yeah. That's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> <unk> a <unk> -- I want to see. It's okay. You know, <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means eight out of 10 decisions and experiences and experiences that give their life to be happened to be 30 and <unk>
People from more than 40, you have no <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we make.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up at its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than anywhere else in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top to the 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to get rid of their body and their options.
When we think about development, we all know that the first five years is crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life and common impact has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear about is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
The journalists gave them <unk> names to the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Not right?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It doesn't happen.
They stole that person the <unk> sense of urgency and ambition and absolutely nothing.
And then every day, young intelligent men like you or your children and daughters come to my office and they say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't own. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day that I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like game play.
They were running over and <unk> but then at some time around the 30s, he turned the music and all began to sit on.
I didn't want to be the only thing I would stay standing, so I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds very <unk> but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to <unk> there's a huge pressure on the '50s and so many of the starting a career, choosing a city, choosing a mate, and have two or three children in a much shorter time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that you start to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything at the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want right now.
You realize you can't have the child you want to now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> they see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the 25, his office came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but we still couldn't decide, so that I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, he was living with a boyfriend, that showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living with a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
It will often happen in our <unk> but then it was getting up, and she doesn't pick your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his legs and I cried for almost the entire hour.
He had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the <unk> words -- please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of you if I get <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like just sitting while the <unk> decade of Emma going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> -- man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that they would benefit from that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
<unk> I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that should not count, that, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and do it count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, what you know about, how do you think about how you think, and where do they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was going to go out of it almost always comes out of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the way we get to this group.
Half of the <unk> works would never be <unk> then, to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work out of the <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you didn't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma will soon give her family, when he has a mate and in a form of his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better enough to sit head than 20 or even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing to the person who you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook begin to walk into the <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before they have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
Your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it or have to have a time to be able to have a time to be able to kill you to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter of a prime man who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That supply of work gave me a reason to leave his boyfriend with the living that she alive.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
He took his new career, she loves his new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now the gaps in emergency government are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good day, a good TED Talk can have enormous effects on the next few or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> -- they're not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, get identity, use their weak <unk> choose your family.
Don't you define what they didn't know or what they didn't.
You're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a job that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to students at seventh grade schools in New York City.
And like any professor, I applied tests and tests.
Let me work.
When the work came, we will get grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance, had no <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children wasn't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it differently.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy of <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> on military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied the <unk> professors working in slums.
We associate with private companies, ask yourself, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the week, but for years, and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live the life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked the thousands of high school students who did my <unk> determination and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the most helpful children had significantly greater helpful than <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the testing tests, even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the determination for children?
What do I do to teach kids a job ethic.
How do I keep them that for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the <unk> is not related or even related to connecting to unintended talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start everything again with the lessons in the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> -- is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can take away this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of Chinese learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single character from every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic academic, 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the websites or the paper.
Today I would start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides, like if I were shouting at <unk> <unk> -- I'm <unk> This is actually <unk> of the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way. What it works.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a <unk>
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call a radical <unk>
These are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a bureaucracy, such as <unk> within the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree loudspeaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> together, it gets very hot.
Three three, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door, put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out on a front door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, <unk> <unk>
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to us, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
An Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile is turned out.
A mouth that tells you where to come out is a <unk>
This is a slide for remind remind you that I must stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz magician together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand of it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial <unk> industrial <unk>
However, the Oz magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
And the trend really took the rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal who had a metal boy and a girl <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as guard the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a great difference between these two films, there's a couple of great differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician magician in <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if Oz was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the world of the evil <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the one of the Oz magician is that the most amazing characters and wise characters are women.
I started noticing this when I did watch Star Wars and my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection, because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>  And so she slid in the room and was impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but I was able to get rid of it.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke one of an army for overthrowing the government?
We had this with the magician magician of <unk>
How do I get Dorothy his movie?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of the world that I want my children to grow up with it, OK?
Why is there such a lot of hard capital force in the movies for our children, and so little of the <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults which is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I really expected that the credits start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is done, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to fight against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so very real and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all times is going on appearing by classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a young girl.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good -- not let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens to the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book in comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there are more than a female character who has lines?
So do you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women speak to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the guy who you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things in each other.
I've seen it, and yet I see it in the cinema we know and we love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood point of quality.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think I'm going to be <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film that happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have deep and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, "Come on to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's take it into the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently to Congress, so it's okay.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to take this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
One in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the history of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge for reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools for our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would have to ask, "Hey, <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of self is changing radically radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star <unk> <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do they have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think it's an expert there.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> go and go and more stories and more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk> magician,
Thank you.
So I was living in Maine and one of the things that I knew most I was looking for sea cookies, on the shores of Maine -- because my parents said that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
It's covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
But over time, I was getting <unk>
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me do <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, in Egypt, my little beach in Egypt, I had grown up with one of almost 1.3 miles of length of length of the <unk>
And my sea crackers had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place in the Eastern Delta.
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like the bright pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes in the landscape caused by building materials and the <unk> <unk>
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old city called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Ottoman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> by <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And he will try to find it when you look for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we used NASA data to make a map, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of mud we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Empire the Middle Empire is exactly the same time that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be very much, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry, the Middle Empire are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a mining assembly shop which shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share the knowledge is the most <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as you think, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
<unk> that the ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. or a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a <unk> group of <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
You can fly around flying around, wheels that goes on its side, the rays of the wheels that ends up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
The <unk> in the hall, or what there is to the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
From their chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you're talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> the tickle by your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie.
They went on a side and enter your living room.
Right in the room, and making the maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his center <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now <unk> the kitchen.
The ground has coated with a way of yellow brick and the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that has done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of the different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> looking at them once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
It took a lot of entire minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the highest order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people need to be phenomena from nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a guy named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, "Do you know when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not an wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old people invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, though a little <unk> said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up most of the year next year, not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that will allow us to see what our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when I come back, it was a lot of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined and <unk> was not just as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would argue that they have changed as cognitive as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited a bunch of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to be wanted to be that it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory champions and the skills of control with the control of the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, <unk> <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were actually <unk> or looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> competitive is moving as an armed race where each year shows someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of it, there's 36 miles of cards <unk> which he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things on these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used to the end of the end of a concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox. It says this: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I'm going to say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, I think there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back later, and I ask you to get that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what do you say?
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said his job is <unk>
The same word, unlike <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't really mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
All the other memories that they dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They were okay when they come back home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we were <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is about 2,500 years ago in Ancient Greece in India.
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
I had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> was <unk>
Let's all come back.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
This is how they couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting here.
I took the <unk> hand to where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or numbers of the phone or instructions or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have a visual and interesting space and remarkable.
If you ask them to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell you who was sitting on the horse you brown <unk> in his <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- and I think, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory, the same way that would have done it if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And it will come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that would you remember that you want to introduce Ed friend <unk>
And then you'd see Britney <unk> to remind that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they came out in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help you remember it.
So it's like <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse but, a typical <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I stuck it full of that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea to write something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event, boring.
And really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school dropout bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's actually about doing is to improve the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really very <unk>
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security bars with tape just leaving two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that had covered a year before. He had the idea that it could be made in a sort of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and numbers of phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with some <unk> about how their minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
So we had a deeply focused on it.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
It will be a kind of deep processing -- a kind of <unk> that most of them is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, which is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, and I left me that this is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who who is walking around our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even engage in process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the guy who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it will be <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> complexity, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was an balcony who gave the living room.
And there everyone passed the <unk> so every time I was going out of my room to the toilet, everyone looked at me, and every time I was <unk> and I would come back wrapped up in a towel -- everyone was looking at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
I had that drive, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and architecture is not about math, but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
It makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it for based on a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, you have a <unk> it has this round of this round thing -- columns, a red brick -- that <unk> <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the <unk> values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we used the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects that constantly drive new technologies new technologies, new solutions for today's life forms.
We just gave them and we just gave them away so far away from the people.
All of the black, this is going to tell us, you believe we think we feel very well, but we are dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started to experience <unk> we make the pendulum back forward, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, it was about the 1970s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate these symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake drawing and use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> and we turn it into skyscraper, that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time on business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we <unk> memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, that's not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now tell us with new design techniques, and we find new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk> happened.
In 1997, the emergence of this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academic and public and public and public were completely agree about a building.
New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half half percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and most of the world was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how it's possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms of culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The main mayors of the world.
So everybody thought if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials happened with another star.
I went to <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the edge of the new millennium, actually started to spend with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of, for example, how do you consume architecture.
thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, which means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very much time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found with buildings like this.
<unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen again. Because we are on the bottom of the greatest revolution in architecture since the <unk> of the steel -- the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes -- almost <unk> and it's actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product in the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people started to get to the social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not only images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell their history, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when we charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded examples of experiment, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library might be in today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are not these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is not an <unk> audience that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one way, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami -- Beach, Florida, it can also serve for sports or for <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are happening.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we've built.
Architects already know how to make buildings, more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for everyone to want.
Finally, we're not in <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, but that they shape the way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries the local libraries and the homes where we form our kids, and the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned to a year and he started walking.
And it does this really cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives himself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it, and when did I stop doing this?
How is we not all taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or fellow members they say, "You don't know who you believe.
So a video of her itself, publishes it on YouTube, and she publishes it on YouTube, and she calls other who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice, or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 3,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy <unk> and stream, that gets these answers to one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We never have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there is a feast in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand is <unk>
This environment, to be always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a online and real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what you have to digitally.
What is the highest thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a every day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls in now.
<unk> <unk> keep dominating our <unk>
<unk> technique is routine.
And <unk> like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare to.
But kids are also not immune to this.
Just like the superheroes of superheroes about sports and the singers and <unk>
So what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and are very <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed in the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls would rather do not do something because they think they don't see enough enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we <unk> the society and the working field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class. <unk> to participate in the classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One in five is not attending at all during the days when you're not comfortable with it.
And in the <unk> season, if you don't think you look at you well, specifically if you don't believe you are <unk> <unk> -- you have a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about that of appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, U.S. and China.
And it turns out irrespective of what these young people weigh from.
So, to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you not about how you really are.
The low quality of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-worth are less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthier than they can bring them into a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at most risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this because of what they make more <unk> like alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, aesthetic surgery, the early ages and no protection and damage <unk>
The search for the perfect body is to set up the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe that they're overweight again, regardless of whether or not have higher rates of <unk>
And 17 percent of women are not presented with a job interview on a day where they don't feel secure with the way they see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would that happen.
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first one is that we need to raise trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, you know, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact on it.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are starting to be <unk> for anybody who will provide a education in self-esteem that works.
One education is a <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the subject and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the status of the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the input of our politicians on hair, or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not because they are seen.
And all of us can start by taking responsibility for the type of images and feedback that we published in our social networks.
Can we engage people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, like governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to grow their entire person, to valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
I'm going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what it can mean for someone in your lives.
Who is in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two seats away. What would she mean if I was released out of that <unk> voice in his interior, that she would tell him for not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this, and it would take their potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let's give our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
It will be <unk> to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's switch each of us, the way we talk and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age, they become a insurance agents for themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the top of November 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of <unk> <unk>
<unk> initially said it was innocent but being prisoner by other <unk> in the company of others, started plan attacks at about 12 icon of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans was <unk> by an FBI informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, we couldn't get rid of it.
He would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer, a <unk> engineer, with a <unk> American mother, primary school master's for the primary school to give me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most of the Muslims, they get to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't require a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
But in all religion, in all of the human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people that were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we have to use all the possible means that they all lived as them.
A few months before my arrest was feeling with me and explained that in the last weekends of a week, he and some friends, had been going to shoot the shooting at Long Island, to practice practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point at the goal to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot was given to the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise you, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and the Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, an son.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they thought to them as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people would be convicted of putting a <unk> <unk> of explosives in the underground parking lot of the North tower north tower in the World tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt a whole other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability of my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody already to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the whites but to be the new class of class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was doing it at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have developed social skills, to put it very much under <unk> it wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was asked by opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they started to test my way of thinking, was during the presidential elections.
On a <unk> program I participated in the <unk> National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of youthful violence, as I had been <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt very much passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids we had done, was Jewish age.
I took a number of days out of the light -- and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in Bush -- <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people who are kind, exactly how I wish I wish to be <unk>
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be a homosexual but I know what is being <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All the nights, Jon Stewart made me become a honest honest with my <unk> and I was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my figure out at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and the Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was going to think, and she told me something that conserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired tired of somebody who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep it all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and to start a new life.
So why did I go out and put me at a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is going to get to the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was given to this violent ideology, and <unk> I didn't have to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has made it in their lives.
For the victims of the terror, <unk> against these meaningless acts, like rejection to my father.
With this simple one, I put myself here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has sound, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like the moments of your childhood you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your <unk> of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a true internal film -- you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
At the way, I know I have an <unk>
I'm not sure you are aware of you.
<unk> is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we need, what we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science in nature, it's objective one.
<unk> for nature, is subjective <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we had that vision.
psychology is studying <unk> behavior, and the neuroscience is going to be the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science Crick <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, to be a flowering of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions that they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are easy problems.
I don't have to offend the <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why is all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a film internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, and how they operate the <unk> how do we adapt and <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- all questions about how the goal works.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we talk about, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between easy problems.
But the difficult problem is the question of why it's all accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, really still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm an <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We used to get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry, explains biology, explains the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, and I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy things before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for some crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and this is about everything that needs the explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, to me, and for many others, that vision is pretty close close to simply denying the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time you go, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as brick <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties do not explain in terms of the most basic terms.
On the contrary, it is considered principles, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can not explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk> laws.
I think that's the situation we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas to <unk> space, time, mass, so load, then for logic -- we have for <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it is not a whole object of science anymore.
It opens up the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect the consciousness, with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the <unk> physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want very simple laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we have.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everybody, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think about "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, it's not.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> that some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do anybody think so <unk>
And partly this comes from the first crazy idea; that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, the time and the mass, is natural to assume that it may be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's very much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind looks more continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing -- there is consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
It's very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I'm not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of information, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an equal degree of information, a pretty significant, degree of conscious awareness.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different <unk> level of zero.
Indeed, a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness, the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers are often observed that physics is inherently abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies it.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire of the <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> <unk> has the potential to solve our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical and serious moral and quite serious social and serious social consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that I think about it, well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of information -- she has a complicated information processing -- integrated information so that the answer is, yes, it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a very serious ethical problem on the ethics of the development of smart computers, and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, at the moment we have a TED consciousness, an inner film for this whole TED group, different from the inner movies of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure of the first crazy idea; that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second crazy idea.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem in the science and philosophy.
We can't wait for that overnight.
But I think we're finally going to get to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, <unk> profile.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to be <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She's not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After I school, I had a <unk> on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What's a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
So years later, I was in the second part of the teaching at a high school school of <unk> just after 20 minutes in the middle class of <unk> and a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when I'll give you your <unk>
I said, <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the <unk> law for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people at the wheels, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experience with disabled people as <unk>
And we don't. And it's not about boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do on this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you to ask them, Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is <unk> A capital -- capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability that makes you extraordinary.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we have been able to spread even more of these lie through social communication.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> Before we <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with black legs of carbon.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we were <unk> to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we <unk> the disabled individuals with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, so bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I have lost the story of the number of times that I've been dealing with how I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had an public profile.
It was as if I was going to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are <unk> people with a benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see you and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really hard.
And so some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I believe the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more hungry because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with it.
I need the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it like <unk>
And I know why it does.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, you're not at least inspired by anything?"
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  And <unk> the ingenious trick of how you can charge the mobile phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stretch of stairs has never ever become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not make the subtitles.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability to be <unk> by getting away from the bed, and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 grade at a high school school in a school in a school is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional soccer with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't get paid.
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives both like the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to figure it out.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework for you to do with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it's run by the game camp at the game of the game to 160 percent -- blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> it with everything else to be.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So some videos to show you what is using the Google <unk> under the hull, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of the <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology that is emerging is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
<unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football camp from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> -- you can see from the angle of a <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
So once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic device that you ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Volunteer: Oh yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan
When I could be <unk> running down the <unk> launching the ball into the bottom of the network? or <unk> by doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you get a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour of a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> the children's sales for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief curriculum on the <unk> technology.
In 1965, the <unk> the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> into his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do it.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was more quick, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that takes in place, you don't have to worry about to forget to forget a <unk>
He or <unk> the strategy.
It just goes out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because they don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate <unk>
If you lose the parties <unk> like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> manual.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the party.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view of the people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> and something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have <unk> of information.
This is going to be good teams of the bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for jokes.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you're the field.
It took the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receptor -- suddenly a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the <unk> system will come in.
It goes into the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open receptor.
You get the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of the reality of <unk>
Let's use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality for empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how usual is their actions from the <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they become <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do -- the decisions we do and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, as well.
Thank you.
I was struck by after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years the country <unk> the south end of the Lofa County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known by their beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring style architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> head engineer who would build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk> test.
Freedom of the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from their openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body strikes the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact <unk> bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of the people die on impact.
The ones that don't usually get into the water <unk> and then you get <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of this method of suicide will be aware of the death of the death that is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order before they get their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official to his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had that day to bring that day back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but the officers as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, official veterans are trained to new government today.
This is Jason <unk>
I met it at July 22 last year when you get a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> near the center.
And when I got there, he looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden Gate Bridge <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked ourselves if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> he leaned on the right, and he was.
This guy and a very clever guy in New Jersey had just taken their life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the following day, the mother of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had tried it.
<unk> damage damage to a lot of people.
So I make these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved -- were <unk>
What do you think?
So what do you say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> or <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels because they probably don't know it.
And just being there, you can be the tipping point that they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending life -- you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save the life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a missing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son on January 19th of this year, and he wrote to me just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go foot to the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends telling their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing moments of moments that Mike didn't really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police officer and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and told me that Mike car was down in the bridge.
I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before <unk> with a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needs to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call by a suicide bomber on the sidewalk on the bridge near the north.
I put my bike. on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, it immediately cross the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next hour and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to go back to that lane and give the life another chance.
When Kevin came out, I was able to get it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that made you <unk> and gave him the hope and life <unk>
And you know what told me.
He said, "I <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> the 11th of September 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I was saying to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we know we know.
Kevin is in order, like <unk>
You thank God for you.
I survive debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, <unk> When I visited the General Hospital in San Francisco that night, you get the patient.
I knew I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is an active father of the society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather became <unk>
That act, despite the end of his own pain, theft of the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Typically, this is only three things: sleep, or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and called suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was left with hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that most people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped of the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second ones that leave the railing they realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell the people, the bridge doesn't only connect to you with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be working on to do.
insulin can prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you are, but you know what you are, and a question ask you, how do you tell you about that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since I was a child.
My outside finally was going to do with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For reasons why I'm going to be going to go by, when I look at this picture -- I think, like, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the color of the skin or the beliefs that we have.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent -- ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called a revelation.
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt <unk>
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take this t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to do it.
The gender always has considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I would never tell myself sharing my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and family who are telling me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist god.
There's a <unk> <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something called me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was going over the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and he won in the bathroom, he won in a bathroom <unk> he won in <unk> and she was third <unk> between over 40 grade.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of <unk> but I do can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you gave the America to you and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I handed two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was engaged in Thailand at 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
And in that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before they change the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power or being able to get a <unk> but for me it was my license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears was <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, lived his truth, but that, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this scenario because of a long history of people that <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best for the others to live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer as much as 20 percent <unk>
My most profound truth took me to accept what I am.
Would you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Of course, first to thank you with all my <unk>
I support my support network, my parents in most of my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young people who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to be a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents usually know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when his efforts went to 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> was very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you took a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the story of <unk> inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when I was born, a girl, his birth didn't get <unk>
It's not welcome or his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, gives her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot for having a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only did you have lost death, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter when it grows, is that they have too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you're home at home and the school for his siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes into 13 years old, you have to stand up from their house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if we had to <unk> the code of that honor, that I could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this sort of code code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters at the name of honor.
And there is one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and it accepts the decisions of their father and their mother choices, even if they can't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if it was <unk> with an old man, she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, she has to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same honor to their children.
And this vicious circle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I came back, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years and a half and a half and a half and a half years of my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention the abuse of a girl in a school?"
Yes, I must <unk>
You can give it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the agricultural societies in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One <unk> to school means that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where they can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they were <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters not to her daughters, and I thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The <unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, only for <unk>
I've been <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and children alike.
I used education for <unk>
I went back to my daughters, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete complete denial of involvement in all of the political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls are banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> and the singers were <unk>
<unk> million, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for your rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, he got up and raised the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog on the BBC, she offered herself to the documentaries of the New York Times Times and talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, <unk> him at the ear of my wife -- "I must tell you what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't bother you."
Let's get the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter inspired by you and you get <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't get back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve muscle was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments and I'm very pleased to share with you that even though being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't just get his job.
You fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> so courageous and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
I didn't know what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and, from that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>  But all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science science, I made it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get into a brain operation.
You're still just as smart or not?
And not like that, you can be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the <unk> the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and chemical mix and try to figure out how to stay alive.
More than once I had saved me.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul for what I decided to do -- to try to get the <unk> dose because there really doesn't have a clear map of what it says in <unk>
I started trying with slightly different mix and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the dramatically dramatic dose, -- my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried to have a very early man and a typical man, and I was surprised by looking at how I thought about my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several types, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just wasn't going on.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do -- since then I spent better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was able to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my new ideas.
<unk> thinking about the images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I use these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works -- to me -- it's very simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking, <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really, really <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director could be able to use your imagination only to lead to the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we are pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used an MRI technology, functional MRI <unk> to represent the brain, here you can see the brain scanning done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The <unk> column shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual while being <unk> watching that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the middle column on the left. You see that the difference is <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine that same picture is <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a great gene array of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new animals, new animals, and as long as it was <unk> a new <unk>
The computer used only the scanning brain information on the scanning of the scan to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
You can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up with us.
We're well close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember when you see a picture and when you look at that same image, you think of the brain that is the same <unk>
This has been done with the brain scanning brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution becomes a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer me.
A lot of them are proposing a lot of new projection of projection by imagery, even me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- we must first ask the following thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger, but at this point, more <unk> magnets just offered little improvements in the resolution -- not increases by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than magnets larger, make better magnets.
We can create a much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
So why cares?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI were to make really big, right?
And yet, most of the recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in <unk> and FM stations, FM systems in MRI systems.
At his time, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns -- structured magnetic patterns.
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of computational Radio processing patterns, we can increase <unk> the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
We can then split up into layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluids of the <unk> but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity -- this is the dream.
We're going to be able to put our ideas directly into the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few more options to open this door.
Anyway, choose a year -- will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay set.
I think we all have <unk>
Their <unk> may be telling some person for the first time that she loves her or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have done in life.
So all of this is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have left out of that <unk>
It's <unk> and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of the South Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> -- I didn't have my armpits to quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope with the <unk> of my pants and so I had <unk> my head -- I was doing a little kid -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And he would find a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it was <unk> inside.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a little kid in three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came up again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to walk around in the female issues at the table.  I had the dates of Betty <unk>
The dating.
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues,"
And so I took a deep <unk> and I went down and my backs and my backs and my backs a little girl in a four years with a pink <unk> looking at what is not a challenge for an atheist <unk> just a little girl with one question: "Are you guys or <unk>
And so I took a little <unk> again, I set out to <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one boy, and you see her clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Because I'm more than the kind of girl of a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite thumb is <unk> and he's got a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was it.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hardest thing to ever ever had.
And because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
So that's how my <unk> is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons for why I get out of my closet it was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> It's difficult not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared bank <unk> it's harder than to say that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I'm going to say is harder than telling your child to five years that you're going to <unk>
There is no more difficult -- only it is hard.
We need to stop to classify what is difficult for the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made out of your walls, it's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine about 20 years ago.
I, that I had a horse line -- a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any kid in four years who would walk into the coffee.
It was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever ever done.
My family, my whole friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that it was gay, and when I make my wife, <unk> and <unk> and walked around the tables and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known for years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried -- <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you ever looked at the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorites, Will and Grace program.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, a woman, but in hopes of trying desperately to show me desperately to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for how to be <unk>
That's how hard conversations are still not to be my strong point.
Ask any of you who have been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves going out of any room is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
Don't give them a sense of fake hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
I would never be surprised by that.
And some of you can go out safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark <unk> I have a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And it may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence has seen -- a productive example -- has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When I was <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the most underlying physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're a alien race that doesn't know about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question as the understanding of the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finely finely finely limited, for the development of intelligence and in particular, for developing states that we prescribe the diversity of future future.
Finally, in the manufacturing movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said for a number of years ago: There is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the equivalent of the closest to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force of force, which acts in order to maximize the future of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom, or keeping the open choices with a force in T, with the diversity of potential buildings, and the <unk> of an imminent time will be <unk>
In short, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping the choices open.
And so having this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Let's get the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to live conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system in which you can find out inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal test, play human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided for his account to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for humanoid robotics and human care technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing on opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game, against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections on a social network where your friends are constantly constantly and maintaining the good network right now.
This same network of Web <unk> has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, finding success and using the Panama Canal to broaden the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> on a simulated array of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of actions, successfully asset assets under their accounting exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behaviors, such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of a single equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep <unk>
So back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> <unk> there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion there.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion and <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence of the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually be made directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets and get out of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to pass the descendants of human intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following: intelligence, intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the entire stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
And yet, in the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which points out that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and combine a little bit of that light that is going to be.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
So together, this helps us understand whether these planets are little and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their dreams.
And at his time, this gives me clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
And these environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have been <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search of life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more we look at planets like Earth, most I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor on Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that has been shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, that's why we study both Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface into search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission would take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now offered not only short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imaginations with the ideas and ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the equatorial areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places that are really <unk> places with Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets and <unk> the implication and the belief that the <unk> and the belief that the Mars and the belief that we hope to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable the Earth.
For so much that I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party will really have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to grasp, to and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Just to find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment that was <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to be able to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we need to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put into the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even more easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window out of the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I got my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I was going to be able to stand right away.
I'm a profession, and I know how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in their place, that <unk> that was bad things going on.
Or at least if it happens, bad things -- you get the likelihood that it's a total total catastrophe happen.
So I started thinking about that, but even one month after my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years ago, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Whenever there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, yeah?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be going wrong, and then tries to figure out what can be done to prevent things or to be able to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is about some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
On the house, you get a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over the course of thousands of years, to make a track of the important things, where the good, where the fish, which is where the fish, which is where the fish, which is looking at medical tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that enables the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are very much.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car glasses and <unk>
So at home I <unk> a place for the keys, a hook along the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you are <unk> with it your stuff always will be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards, a picture of your credit card card license to drive, "Hey, <unk> by mail that you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, all of us will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or your own friends, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of us in medical choices, and actually for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you may have to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for that most doctors don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be able to have surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And you must think about what kinds of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me anything if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's blame for someone, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to deal with the most widely <unk> which is what you think it is?
How many people have to take it off before they help a person?
300.
This is what the research of recent researchers happened: <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I will explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why do not be <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic -- and it's <unk> of the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, <unk> -- five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you look at this over time, so they don't have to make the chain reasoning on the act.
300 people are taking the drug off, right? A person has five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help you.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic involves it, it's part of the informed consent of informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical.
So for the surgery that is done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number needs to deal with it is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgery for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue with that we can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, you want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> or a <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, doesn't react very quickly. You might be the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that are going through the window during those moments of stress is the <unk> <unk> as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered <unk> and lots of messages that I haven't read for.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> and you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system -- the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came in for the decade of 1800, and over the time of time, it mixed with local signs and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following an blindly of their rules, put behaviors and <unk> behaviors and laws.
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers, and <unk> the sound.
And we <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can make sound, and I've seen how people answers.
I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you're not going to be <unk> on the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound that's for coming next.
So this cartoon drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to do the thumb with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic apartment there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my <unk>
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I can experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
On the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a known person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell me.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> their voices, I am able to maintain a kind of temporary form of value something like taking a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could do it in the forget and not have any social value.
So with the sound like my new medium. It was <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and completely express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> what it means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better to understand how it works <unk>
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the facial expression, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, the speed, the way the piano, the English is a linear language, like it is <unk> just a key at once.
But the <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers in the safe way to express a very clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If just a key to change the belt would create completely different.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, we can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal, in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through your music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and put it in.
This is all day."
If you look at it, and it <unk> the visual speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time expressed in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands, the present one is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a specific term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
But when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think would automatically be automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of the hands in the top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second thing I would like to show you is -- please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please get back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest -- but they have very different understanding.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very strict world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe the people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a wide trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to show you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you do it all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom is responsibility.
But my imagination carried me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a zero-sum bubble or a ignorance bubble I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up the ones of the other.
The time happened, now I'm adult and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect these plastic chunks of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it takes an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it is also very risky to use these enormous ships.
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> labor with <unk> so that the children very <unk> also will participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are <unk> very much with robots.
Then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at the prototype of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned the light off and web cameras, and we put it into a floating robot, which is slowly moving through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see these plastic chunks floating around the sensor, while the computer on board will process this picture and measure the size of every <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step into a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The cool thing on this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to hide it immediately.
But my students in Hong Kong -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, you see the Internet, the Internet, and you get into this image of this image.
A child, maybe lower than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using my hands, in <unk> the largest largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> where the water where they live in.
You can see also that water is brown, and the oil is brown and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that make spectra different, what you can help to identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor, and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help form other children.
I was able to research a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also more like me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we started a lot of giant giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> protected various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 12,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to an average of 300 tons you're still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it's very safe -- it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't do it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of masks <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> your whole life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to see that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized an civil expedition to the nuclear power to date.
We can zoom up to a mile of the plant center, and with the <unk> aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a sediment <unk> as we we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been beginning to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit smaller so that we found a industrial installation in Hong Kong and turn it into the largest space and environmental impact on the environment.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wooden metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost everything in there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked ourselves things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or we can help in mobility from the advanced population transforming their standard wheels in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic and the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, creators -- we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- two radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic is.
It imposes over the environment, the other thought we thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the retail <unk> he saw a figure that fights for free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, cells, we took all the information that was required for every cell to run and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production and mass production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One acts mainly like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually moving its functionality through variation.
Here's a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> of every designer and architect to work on the <unk> and architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, it shows on two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
Would you probably ask why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a very rare moment, where four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we never had had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, products, structures and tools by scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters of diameter with a force that may someday be very far away to print <unk> buildings, and graphics and the nanoscale <unk> -- have genetically engineered <unk> that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is just to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second kind of <unk> skin, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with an collaborator of 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D skirt without seams between the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> combines materials and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> machine.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the instruments of <unk> it allows to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher -- my collaborator, we went back to nature for <unk> and to design this pattern of surface surface, it becomes <unk>
It was <unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, they vary their functionality not by addition to another material, or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a tree -- <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
The tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made from place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if the objects were made of a single part?
You get a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree with fruit and fruit and found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and 100 million tons is produced every year by organisms.
We thought that if we could tune their property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>   <unk> a bunch of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We had the chemical concentrations that we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, very hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single material about three minutes long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it stops dry them to find a natural form of contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the process of printing used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, and <unk> the bacteria designed to capture a rapid carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of beam to mesh, and if it broadens more, to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best number of objects designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life and put in the ground, will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration of our next exploration is the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- they are <unk> new biological basic channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of laundry -- two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the tar ponds of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces the biofuels in the built environment.
But these two legs, you don't know in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They're here, for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by selection, natural selection, but evolution design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the tract tract is going to help us make these bacteria and to make their way into the road.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material into the fabric of <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> to make more transparent channels.
This system is <unk> when it stretch from one end to another, it spans 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We're <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, to <unk> the damaged and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer would make a material on layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers to each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces in life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of the best understanding of how this complex process works, attach a magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the caterpillar of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat environment, not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat caterpillar and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different different environments, and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
You often get the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing the raw silk without boiling <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> into the dark and <unk> and <unk> and so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and heat -- <unk> silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a silk farm, online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be tested with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> they give all this together and your integrity.
And over two or three weeks, we <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> they produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> by a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings that surround us, to form a <unk> ecology of materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads us to a inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time we make ourselves in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were asked for the first time this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and he came up with websites in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may hear about us.
And generally I like to prove and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, it's no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was excited about something completely different, and I was excited about it, and I'm going to leave you in it, and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern was caused by anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing, to deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me as much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me -- I don't know at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of commitment, or to be wrestled or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have ever raised then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned about culture.
We ask the first question, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one matters what you <unk> at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in the children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students just ask them to go out in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of the way that we take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream about what they might be, not inspires to dream of anything they might be.
In fact, it's just the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't be answered with 20 different things, even though the good adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of manifest or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that show their curiosity and a lot of different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we have to think about the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance, the ideal was the ideal of the ideal for multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You get any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths going to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization from data, and mathematics and design.
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of the unique idea of his <unk> and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
It comes from new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second superpower, <unk> is fast.
When we <unk> we are <unk> on something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid to try and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and independent <unk>
As an incredible pianist to get an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the oldest <unk>
Before it turned into a writer, <unk> it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the very smaller sales mechanics when they started your thumb, and this ability to help write it for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to be able to go to what you're going to do, even if you end it down.
It is possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is the adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the name of videos, but other Internet designer designer. sometimes appeal to Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take over different <unk> depending on your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have a complex problems, and we need some creative thinkers to deal with them in front of them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
knowing the belly knowing why they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams of teams of a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep at depth and put ideas, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design life and careers that we are connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely are <unk> that they simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you will take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring is whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then you get through all the media.
That's where you can give the best thing to do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep their curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more genuine happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
And in the year I went to a woman named <unk> the led to a psychiatric psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but it was to her until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange clay and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who never had seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If we had been living today, we could not give it more help than he was <unk> he gave him a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has come very much.
They've been discovered and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has moved into Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists that work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend your years with Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or want to be dear Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., Alzheimers cancer costs 200 billion dollars a year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is lost in Alzheimer's disease.
This is the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times by 2050, as well as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one who can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases than other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but all the <unk> world Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of us, all of us, even scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it will be <unk> on a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy healthy brain compared to the patient's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to adding a severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's met plates and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain does a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that goes into an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> <unk> are <unk>
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There is a lot of steps, and the identification of what happened to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
It was <unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have reduced the cables and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, physical <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we have managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when these drugs were in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick into each other within them, like human disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to convince them that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we think about it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have been <unk> more research and <unk> pressure about governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there is 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
In love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience as a night of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to do 36 questions more and more personal and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number three: When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
And so they <unk> that these are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to get your partner what you like to him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail was really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I didn't get rid of us, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column, and it gives you a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I suppose some of you would probably ask, keep it together.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because they've done this question over and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before I published the paper was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been excited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually only about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have some thousands of view.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it was gone, I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and on Saturday, it happened to my blog.
And the Sunday, the <unk> had called <unk> Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with mutual experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an international news has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call them or I had about it, what they did every day for weeks, they would ask the first question: still keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it up.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international career, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called San <unk> which included the experiences of readers to prove the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, most of all, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you get together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there was the goal of the researcher for the researcher to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for <unk> <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt more close after doing that, several studies later they used to use <unk> protocol as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and community and community, and they have used it between people with <unk> policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> by it.
And I said, "Do you want to tell you that you are going to tell you that the person will <unk>
Well, he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
We knew that they managed to get better better after testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I didn't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to practically my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I came up with science.
And I did all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was just asking for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. Am I more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I expect.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can to demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> on the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that the people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks you still together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, we would have to ask questions more difficult questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get together, and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to yourself, or even more, how you live with doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more bold conversation about what to mean somebody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known thing and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I shudder a little bit at the reading now, not because it wasn't true, but because in the moment, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think about how many times we have both to make that decision, and how much times will I keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough and responded 36 questions, and I've chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper newspaper.
But what I've done in change, is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I actually didn't wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian in full mountain and in a way, I got a <unk> <unk>
I read the city in New York doing a while.  So something really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood and <unk> a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a number of aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going out of <unk> and <unk> and all those <unk> things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> and Agnes Martin, the <unk> of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it's <unk> and so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking she could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of the opposite of it, somehow it seemed like it grew up in size, like it was that it was going to be the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add these strange electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I could find on the street, all that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out, and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realize that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> just like a dead guy in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of <unk>
First of all, let me get the idea to make an idea.
Then I did some kind of insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural size, with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I got <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheet -- similar to the drawing of a window and then another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition on it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- which I call <unk>
For the <unk> inspired me in a lot of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters old.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
You're going from the world from representation, to this <unk> <unk> where you get <unk>
Here is where the creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god strapped to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there's all kinds of weird things that can be found if they look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out it in a hand while in the other hand they get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a <unk> thing.
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and spitting clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail of a <unk> tail, which joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn fire on the <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made of terrorist cards.
You've got them <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very <unk> for his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> or magazine <unk>
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human, and travel in 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 kilos with a human <unk>
This has a little cave on my chest.
That's the <unk> the chest, is the <unk>
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick primer on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world -- and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people in hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that's living on.
And together we come to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, does not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first happens by your stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system and it <unk> so that any drug <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a great problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to reduce the amount of viruses in blood, and to increase the heart cells.
But they are also known by their <unk> side effects in its most negative, because in the time they take it to your current. They get <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get into fate, which is where it's more important -- in the <unk> of HIV.
These are regions of the body like <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the bloodstream of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cancer cells.
This is the great issue of HIV treatment with current drugs that is an oral treatment treatment
One day, I sat down and I thought to be able to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery surgery, can be used for anything else -- including the drug supply of medicines.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, that open and close holes immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce the medicines.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a laser <unk> on the cell membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell is absorbed the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before I even realized, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> You can <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, he runs to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug that releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this is not very much at the moment.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. One cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> the armed organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these Congolese agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation transition to violent <unk>
I work in the field of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor in the non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any successful conflict process.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why I think about how they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed fight and the politics are not armed with <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
Social groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social service network and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian attacks, also known by their suicide attacks, and also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking again.
<unk> a complex <unk> communication machine, radio, channels of TV channels and Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here is the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their strength, to increase their funds, and build their brand.
Social groups also do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of Taliban in an Afghanistan divided by the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price income for the population.
But in general, providing social services are filling up an empty <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the <unk> victory of 2006 is not allowed to understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by the government, and come up like armed and political groups participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can fewer <unk> as something as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all their functions, they collect the trash <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of states, with no state and hybrids and the weaker the states are states, like in the Middle East and the Middle East and the <unk> of the <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in <unk> tools.
We put that government emptiness has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and <unk>
If we understand better groups -- we'll understand better what incentives to offer the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors who are not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill up that security emptiness to fill up that government emptiness that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a feminist.
My views of gender gender are <unk> but I'm afraid that accepting openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would tell me as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> which might be feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word <unk>
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which calls too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that <unk> woman to realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine it being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It will be the same for the same for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it in easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need for <unk> checks or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and so much more.
We need to have to account for these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music by volume.
Even though the letter degrades to women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by the musical form.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
They came from fashion journals.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories, that make it happen.
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, is her choice, and I'm not one who <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to the same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women become vulnerable when they are <unk>
So let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- the working workers, gay and <unk> in favor of white, <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist man.
It also happens to be this: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put psychologists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it's going to be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I was a <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that virus means for fear of not being able to fulfill with a little bit realistic expectations of it.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, seeing this star star embracing the <unk> pop star and do knowing women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began the endless debates if we were to be able to be <unk> or not a feminist.
It will make his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so <unk>
We're going to go so much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from the <unk> to the day, and will be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they prescribe the change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the gender that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
These are two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
And where they are told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not dealing with women as well as dumb objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post your magazine to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't bring a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desktop -- or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they are engaged in these kinds of projects, and we can also help them to be included as far as we are <unk> to overcome barriers to jobs.
Because we are not <unk> we have these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power directors and producers of music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting change and significant change.
We can also tell our courage to your friend, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids were excited when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if I was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all of it didn't get me to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear and see me and see that none of us is the fact that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal to a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most unlikely diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents had fear of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, it wasn't the paper that unleashed education unleashed on autism, and the <unk> <unk> disqualified and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in endangered their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it is they create a whole professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the reports of prevalence continued to stable only three or four children for every 10 dollars.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> organizations like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, like an epidemic, as if I could be <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people from the Center for Disease Disease Disease  What's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better <unk> detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for his child of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were it so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power.
For the most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what the autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Johns <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like a private worlds <unk> to people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun during hours by waving their hands in their faces, but they were prey to panic as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the prime authority of the world in the subject, I declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as a <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine out of 10 children out by other doctors to their office being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child diseases caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been carefully kept on a refrigerator that didn't get <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records. He said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents who had heard their parents who were desperate to win their approval
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it was not until the 1970s, which researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of welfare mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was both <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter named <unk>
And John knew how difficult it was to raise a girl as a child without special education, without special education, and no access to other without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Foreign Service, that they needed more resources for the autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was so much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk> <unk>
In the other way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful pictures, and <unk> as he said, and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How had no one ever noticed these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the year after the paper article in <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> about his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document gives an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic that is integrated with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the children followed their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability of life that required forms of support and space adapted for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients as patients, as I called their little teachers, and he went to help in the development of education methods that were particularly suited for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse frontier that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known as the awkward social scientist, and the professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> which is the limited model of <unk> by a wide and inclusive.
These changes didn't fall in a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between looking at them to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little bit of <unk> <unk> of the experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> <unk> and teachers all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of <unk> started <unk> like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it is so that it were, making the people with autism, and their families will finally support the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple <unk> and <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the estimate of the prevention of the prevention of preventing that one in the 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic groups are one of the largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, people are autistic people with the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are to solve for the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social, and suffers from an deficit deficit on the details.
No doubt the autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers who have capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in their children's potential.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
